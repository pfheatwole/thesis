This project investigates the design requirements for building a wind field
regression model using position-only time series data from a paraglider flight
track. The ability to recreate the wind conditions from individual flights
enables the possibility of learning wind patterns from databases of recorded
flights.

[[I was using terminology like "feasibility", but I never did really establish
feasibility, did I?]]

[[Elaborate: the purpose alone isn't good enough. **What were the outcomes?**
For example, the stages of the proposed processing pipeline; the paraglider
model; statistical learning methods for the model; simulated-based filtering
for the wind. How am I making clear advances towards immediate success, or
towards preparing future research for success?]]
