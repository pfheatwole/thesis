This is in contrast to other known approaches which typically sacrifice optimality to attain space efficiency. The main idea behind our approach is to dynamically exploit the existence of similarity and/or correlation between the time series. The more the similarity between the time series the less space required to compute the DTW between them. To the best of our knowledge, all other techniques to speedup DTW, impose apriori constraints and do not exploit similarity characteristics that may be present in the data. We conduct experiments and demonstrate that SparseDTW outperforms previous approaches.},

A user can specify the dynamics of this process together with how the state relates to partial and noisy observations that have been made. Inference and prediction then involves solving a challenging inverse problem: calculating the conditional distribution of quantities of interest given the observations. This article reviews Monte Carlo algorithms for solving this inverse problem, covering methods based on the particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter. We discuss the challenges posed by models with high-dimensional states, joint estimation of parameters and the state, and inference for the history of the state process. We also point out some potential new developments which will be important for tackling cutting-edge filtering applications.},

  doi = {10.1017/S0001924000027974},
  abstract = {An analysis of paraglider performance has revealed that wing section drag is the most significant contribution to overall drag. Wind tunnel measurements performed on two-dimensional hollow models indicate that intake drag is less significant than previously thought. An experimental investigation into the characteristics of a `quasi ' -two-dimensional flexible model consisting of solid ribs covered with a fabric skin was performed at realistic Reynolds numbers. The main cause of performance deterioration was found to be a significant reduction in section lift coefficient when compared to a similar solid wing section. This is believed to be mainly due to two factors: a large trailing edge separation and the deformation of the wing between ribs. The deformation was measured and it was shown that the deformed shape is less capable of generating high lift coefficients than the design section. It is thought that the extent of the trailing edge separation is increased due to the presence of streamwise grooves caused by the shape deformation of the wing. The shape of the separated region was found to be strongly three-dimensional with the separation point being about half a chord-length further upstream along the ribs. A small separation bubble was also observed immediately behind the lip of the intake, due to the fabric `flaring' open. Based on the observations presented a number of suggestions for improved wings have been made.},

  abstract = {Calculation procedures for viscous/inviscid analysis and mixed-inverse design of subcritical airfoils are presented. An inviscid linear-vorticity panel method with a Karman-Tsien compressiblity correction is developed for direct and mixed-inverse modes. Source distributions superimposed on the airfoil and wake permit modeling of viscous layer influence on the potential flow. A two-equation lagged dissipation integral method is used to represent the viscous layers. Both laminar and turbulent layers are treated, with an e9-type amplification formulation determinining the transition point. The boundary layer and transition equations are solved simultaneously with the inviscid flowfield by a global Newton method. The procedure is especially suitable for rapid analysis of low Reynolds number airfoil flows with transitional separation bubbles. Surface pressure distributions and entire polars are calculated and compared with experimental data. Design procedure examples are also presented.},
