Variometer Debiasing via Dynamic Time Warping
=============================================

.. todo::

    Probably belongs as a subsection of "Filtering" or somesuch

Talking points:
 * How GPS lags the variometer
   
 * How GPS lag causes a smoothing effect

 * How altitude pressure introduces a bias with changing altitude

 * Determing the vario bias from the two tracks

 * Issues with aligning the two sequences
