<h3><span class="section-number">10.1.1. </span>Study: drag breakdown<a class="headerlink" href="#study-drag-breakdown" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>A common question for curious pilots is how to reduce the drag of their glider
so they can improve the glide ratio or top speed of their wing. The natural
progression of this curiosity is wonder where all the drag comes from in the
first place. One way to answer that question is to plot the drag contributions
from each component <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id7" title="Holger Babinsky. Aerodynamic improvements of paraglider performance. In 17th Applied Aerodynamics Conference, 3148. 1999.">50</a>]</span>.</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 10.1 </span><span class="caption-text">Drag breakdown for Niviuk Hook 3 23 with a pod harness.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Viscous drag includes effects such as the sheer forces produced by the
viscosity of the air, and the pressure drag due to flow separation (the
“vacuum” that can occur on the downwind side of an object); these forms of drag
occur on every surface of the glider, including the lines and payload. Inviscid
drag is less intuitive: commonly referred to as “lift-induced drag”, it is the
energy lost in the vorticity that the wing sheds into its wake as a side-effect
of producing lift.</p>
<p>This diagram provides a satisfying look into the behavior of a wing across the
range of speeds. At the low end, pilots understand that the “brakes” will slow
the wing by increasing its drag, but may be surprised to discover that the
increase in drag is dominated by how the wing produces lift. At the high end,
it can be surprising to learn what proportion of the total system drag is
produced by the seemingly-negligible suspension lines. Although drag is just
one piece of the lift/drag ratio, this sort of breakdown is valuable for
estimating how much improvement is possible by (for example) reducing the drag
of the payload.</p>
<p>This decomposition is also educational because it offers another perspective of
how each component of the wing affects the overall design. Consider the general
guideline that paraglider wings are designed to achieve their maximum glide
ratio at “trim” (zero controls), which usually coincides with the speed that
minimizes the total system drag (as seen here). Now suppose the design was
changed; for example, increasing the aspect ratio of the canopy will tend to
decrease its lift-induced drag, which in turn requires repositioning the
payload at trim. The complete system behavior is a complex interaction of
components, and having access to a parametric model such as this is an
excellent resource for quickly answering questions about glider efficiency by
developing an intuition of how their interactions affect the system behavior.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.1.2. </span>Study: effects of Reynolds numbers and apparent mass<a class="headerlink" href="#study-effects-of-reynolds-numbers-and-apparent-mass" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>There were two questions at the start of this project that affected my modeling
choices:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>How significant are the effects of apparent mass?</p></li>
<li><p>How significant are the effects of accurate Reynolds numbers?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both contributions to the flight dynamics are typically neglected in paraglider
dynamics models without clear justification or discussion of their expected
impact on model accuracy. The models developed in this paper can be used to
provide insight on those questions. Using the Niviuk Hook 3 (size 23) component
models created for the <a class="reference internal" href="demonstration.html"><span class="doc">Demonstration</span></a>, a programming script created
multiple instances of the 6-DoF system models, configuring them to either
respect or ignore the effects of apparent mass and precise Reynolds numbers
(which are normally computed dynamically for each wing section). Pairs of
models — one with the full dynamics and the other lacking one or both effects
— are put into a figure-8 maneuver starting at that model’s equilibrium state
and receiving the same control inputs over a span of 60 seconds. (The maneuver
did not use weight shift control to avoid possible issues modeling canopy
deformations.) Three simulations were run:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>To show the affect of neglecting apparent mass
(<a class="reference internal" href="#figure8-apparent-mass"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10.2</span></a>)</p></li>

<li><p>To show the combined effect of neglecting both apparent mass and accurate

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The differences produced by each simplification are similar in this case, and
will be discussed jointly. First, the less noticeable difference between the
two simulations in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure8-reynolds-and-apparent-mass"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10.4</span></a> is the total
altitude loss, where the “fixed Reynolds, no apparent mass” model descended an
extra 2 meters. The difference is not visually interesting so no side-view is
shown, but the effect is worth noting and should be expected for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>There is minimal acceleration in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>-direction so the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>-component of the apparent mass is negligible.</p></li>
<li><p>The sections most impacted by the incorrect Reynolds values are at the
outside of the span. Since the majority of the lift is produced by the
central sections, which are already near the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re = 2 \times 10^6\)</span>
value, total lift is not greatly affected by assuming a fixed value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The more significant effect was on the lateral motion of the glider, which is
easier to see from a top-down perspective
(<a class="reference internal" href="#figure8-reynolds-and-apparent-mass-topdown"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10.5</span></a>), where the complete
model exhibited a turn radius of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(54 \, [m]\)</span> versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(51 \, [m]\)</span> of
the simplified model. (The cumulative horizontal distances traveled were
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(522 \, [m]\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8.7 \, \left[\frac{m}{s}\right]\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(532 \,
[m]\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8.87 \, \left[\frac{m}{s}\right]\)</span>, respectively.) Again, the
effect is expected for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Apparent mass resists changes to the translational velocity, which reduced
the complete models centripetal acceleration and prevented it from producing
as narrow a turn as the simplified model.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower Reynolds values resulted in lower lift coefficients, especially for
sections with deflected trailing edges (since their increased curvature
magnifies the viscous effects). The lift vectors of sections on the inside
semispan are angled into the turn and pull the canopy into the circle, so
reducing their lift contributions further reduced the complete models

<p>Because these affects are heavily dependent on the glider design and specific
flight maneuvers, this discussion focused on the qualitative nature of these
effects. Whether these sources of error are significant depend heavily on the
model (the canopy geometry in particular, as well as target airspeed of the
glider) and its application. For example, when developing a linearized model to
generate an error term for a control model these effects can be safely
neglected, but any long-run simulation should review their specific control
sequence (because turning magnifies their impact). With this model, checking
the impact of such choices is readily available.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.1.3. </span>Study: indirect thermal interactions<a class="headerlink" href="#study-indirect-thermal-interactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>A reliable way to start a lively discussion on a paragliding forum is to
question what happens when a wing encounters a thermal on only one side of its
wing. Some pilots will argue that the thermal will pull the wing in; other
pilots will argue that the thermal will push the wing away. A grand desire of
this project was that the resulting flight dynamics model might be able to shed
light on why two seasoned pilots might hold such opposing views.</p>
<p>This final study used the Niviuk Hook 3 size 23 components from the
<a class="reference internal" href="demonstration.html"><span class="doc">Demonstration</span></a> with a 6-DoF system dynamics model. The scenario is
simple: place a thermal slightly off-center of the path of a paraglider flying
straight forward at equilibrium with symmetric brakes. Because the span of the
wing is only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8.84 \, [m]\)</span>, the thermal was placed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(15 \, [m]\)</span> to
the right with exponential falloff such that the thermal strength was reduced
to 5% by the time it reached the center of the canopy with a peak (core)
strength of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 \, [\frac{m}{s}]\)</span> (extremely strong for such a tight
thermal). The effect of the exponential falloff was a peak gradient of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.67 \, [\frac{m}{s}]\)</span> from the wingtip nearest the thermal to the
center of the canopy as the glider passed the core.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id5">

<div class="legend">
<p>The first row represents the Euler angles for position, the second row
represents the angular velocities, and the third row is the angular
accelerations.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These results can be viewed in two ways: quantitatively and qualitatively. From
a quantitative perspective the results are disappointing: the absolute angular
deviations were on the order of 1°, which seem impossibly small for pilots to
argue over. From a qualitative perspective, however, the results are perhaps
more interesting. As the wing passes the thermal, the canopy initially rolls to
the right (into the thermal), pitches forward (into the thermal), and the
adverse yaw twists the wing to the left (away from the thermal); although the
angular deviations are tiny it may produce an effect similar to falling, which
needs only a small distance to produce a striking sensation. The same logic
applies after the initial response, where the accelerates again, but more
rapidly, and in the opposite direction: now the wing is rolling away from the
thermal while yawing into it. Perhaps the sensation of acceleration holds the
key to the argument: whether a pilot is more sensitive to roll or yaw, and
whether they’re more sensitive to the initial or secondary accelerations may
offer a partial explanation?</p>
<p>Personally I find this argument unconvincing. Despite the potential explanation
offered by the qualitative analysis, it seems much more likely that the model
has failed to capture one or more of the significant dynamics of the system.
One possible cause is the foil aerodynamics model, which is not intended to
capture unsteady aerodynamics; despite its accuracy in the wind tunnel testing,
it may be inadequate for this level of subtlety in dynamic scenarios. Another
possible cause is the quasi-rigid-body assumption imposed on the canopy
geometry; real wings would flex and distort, especially in such a strong
thermal, and it seems like that such deformations may play a larger roll that
anticipated.</p>
<p>All in all, despite the underwhelming results the truth is this was always an
ambitious goal, and I hope it demonstrates the theoretical advantages of
pursuing flight dynamics models that are capable of capturing the effects of
non-uniform wind vectors along the span of the wing, and will serve as
a starting point for some future work. Perhaps we will someday have an answer
for the forums.</p>

centroid is not the primary control mechanism for weight shift control. The
alternative mechanism is the wing deformations that occur during weight
shift. At the outset of this project the assumption was that the canopy
deformations during weight shift would be negligible compared to the
displacement of payload mass, but the turn radius and sink rate suggest
otherwise. It may be fruitful to generate plausible <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz(s, \delta_w)\)</span>
design curves (so the foil arc deforms as a function of weight shift), and
consider if the changes to the canopy aerodynamics would explain the
inaccuracies in the rigid canopy model. If canopy arc deflections prove to be
a significant factor for accurate weight shift predictions, they should
probably be implemented as an interaction between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz(s)\)</span> and the
suspension line model. (Paraglider pilots quickly discover the relationship
between chest riser strap width and weight shift control, which strongly
suggests that the lines play a dominant role).</p></li>
<li><p>Choice of airfoil: the <a class="reference internal" href="demonstration.html"><span class="doc">Demonstration</span></a> chose the NACA 24018 as an
example of a conservative guess, but if a few commercial section profiles

<li><p>Deflected profiles: the demonstration used section <a class="reference internal" href="demonstration.html#profiles"><span class="std std-ref">Profiles</span></a> produced
by a “two circle” model of trailing edge deflection. That optimistic model
was designed to balance the accuracy of profile deformation against the
ability to estimate the aerodynamic coefficients with XFOIL. In reality,
their unnaturally smooth curvature likely causes them to underestimate flow
separation. Future work would benefit from more accurate deflection profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>Aerodynamic coefficients: in conjunction with more accurate deflection
profiles, another improvement would be is to use more sophisticated methods
to estimate the aerodynamic coefficients. One option is RFOIL from Delft
University of Technology (a fork of XFOIL that is reported to improve
estimates, particularly at high angles of attack), or to apply a complete
computational fluid dynamics approach with OpenFoam.</p></li>
