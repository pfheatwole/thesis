<p>The motivation for this project was a need for flight dynamics models of
commercial paraglider wings. The goal of this project was to create parametric
<a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html"><span class="doc">component models</span></a> that can approximate those
flight dynamics by augmenting the [[limited available specifications with
assumptions of the unknown structure]].</p>
<p>This chapter demonstrates one possible workflow to estimate the parameters of
the component models by combining publicly available technical specifications
and photographs with knowledge of typical paraglider wing design. Once the
components are combined into a <a class="reference internal" href="system_dynamics.html"><span class="doc">system model</span></a>, it is
validated by comparing its estimates of the glider’s longitudinal steady-state
aerodynamics over the range of control inputs against published performance
data, such as minimum sink rate and speed range. The chapter concludes by
demonstrating how flight dynamics models can be used to study paraglider
behavior.</p>

<p>The paraglider wing used in this example is a Niviuk Hook 3. With forgiving
flight characteristics targeting advanced beginners, this wing is not intended
for acrobatics, so the <a class="reference internal" href="foil_aerodynamics.html#limitations"><span class="std std-ref">limitations</span></a> of
the <a class="reference internal" href="foil_aerodynamics.html#phillips-numerical-lifting-line"><span class="std std-ref">aerodynamics method</span></a> are not an issue when simulating the majority of flights
produced by this wing.</p>

<p>Wing data for a commercial wing is typically limited to four sources:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Technical specifications and user manuals</p></li>
<li><p>Flight test data from certifications and reviews</p></li>
<li><p>Pictures and videos</p></li>
<li><p>Physical measurements</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For this chapter, only the first three will be utilized. Although physical
measurements are ideal, they are frequently difficult to obtain (especially for
older wings). Instead, this demonstration is focused on showing that it is
feasible to create an approximate wing model even if physical measurements are
unavailable.</p>

<p>Recall that a “paraglider wing” includes both the canopy and the suspension
lines, so the technical data describes both components. It also includes the
weight range that the wing can safely carry while retaining control authority,
which will be used to define a suitable payload.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.1.2. </span>Canopy<a class="headerlink" href="#canopy" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The first component model of the paraglider system is for the <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#canopy"><span class="std std-ref">canopy</span></a>. The canopy model combines an (idealized)
<a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html"><span class="doc">Foil geometry</span></a> model with physical details to estimate the aerodynamics
and inertial properties of the canopy. For the canopy model parameters, it’s
easiest to think of them in two groups:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Parameters for the <a class="reference internal" href="derivations.html#parametric-design-curves"><span class="std std-ref">design curves</span></a> that define the variables <a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html#equation-simplified-foil-geometry-variables">(2.15)</a>
of the <a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html#simplified-model"><span class="std std-ref">foil geometry model</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Parameters for the physical details <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#equation-canopy-parameters">(4.10)</a></p></li>
</ol>
<section id="foil-geometry">
<h4><span class="section-number">7.1.2.1. </span>Foil geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#foil-geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p class="rubric" id="layout">Layout</p>
<p>The first part of specifying a foil geometry is to layout the scale, position,
and orientation of its sections.</p>
<p>For a parafoil, it’s easiest to start by describing the geometry of the
flattened (uninflated) canopy before dealing with the arc. This approach is
made much easier by the choice of the <a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html#simplified-model"><span class="std std-ref">Simplified model</span></a> to
define the <a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html#simplified-model-section-index"><span class="std std-ref">section index</span></a> as the
normalized distance along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz\)</span>-curve. When a parafoil is flattened
the section index corresponds to the normalized distance along each semispan,
which allows the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-positions and chord lengths to be measured directly
without regard for the arc.</p>
<p>First, consider the chord length distribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c(s)\)</span>. The technical
specifications only list the root, tip, and mean chord lengths, so more
information is required. Thankfully, for parafoils a reasonable guess is that
the wing uses a truncated elliptical distribution. (Paragliding wings commonly
use truncated elliptic functions because they encourage elliptical lift
distributions, thus reducing induced drag.) Such a truncated elliptical
distribution can be easily parametrized by the wing root and wing tip section
chord lengths, as shown by the <a class="reference internal" href="derivations.html#elliptical-chord"><span class="std std-ref">Elliptical chord</span></a> design
curve. The technical specs list these two parameters as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_\textrm{root}
= 2.58\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_\textrm{tip} = 0.52\)</span>, respectively. Using those values
produces a standard mean chord length of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.06\)</span>, which exactly matches
the value listed in the manufacturers specs, so the assumption was justified.
An additional check is to compare the area of the flattened chord surface
projected onto the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(xy\)</span>-plane; for these values the truncated elliptical
produces a flattened area of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(22.986\)</span> compared to the true specification
of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(23.0\)</span>, which further confirms the design. (The small discrepancy may
be explained by differences in measuring methodology or by the current absence
of any geometry twist, but in practice the effect is negligible.)</p>
<p>Next is the fore-aft positioning of the sections, which are controlled by the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_x(s)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x(s)\)</span> design curves. Although traditional wing
geometry models would effectively choose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_x(s) = 0\)</span> and measure the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-offsets of each section’s leading edge, that choice often produces an
unnecessarily complicated <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x(s)\)</span> function. Instead, paragliders can often
be described with constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_x(s)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x(s) = 0\)</span>. As with the
chord lengths, the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_x(s)\)</span> is easiest to estimate from the
flattened wing; in fact, flattened drawings are commonly available in technical
manuals, making them especially convenient. (Admittedly, such drawings do not
always maintain the true aspect ratio, and so should be used with caution.) For
this wing, a small amount of trial and error using a top-down view from the
wing user manual suggests a constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_x(s) = 0.7\)</span> gives a strong
agreement with the drawing in the manual, as seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#hook3-topdown"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7.2</span></a>.</p>

<p>With the flattened chord surface completed, the next step is to define the
<em>arc</em> (position in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz\)</span>-plane) to bend the flattened surface into its
characteristic shape. Photos of the wing suggest that an elliptical arc segment
is likely. The exact value of the arc reference points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{yz}(s)\)</span> has
a minimal impact for typical parafoils (which have relatively small geometric
twist), but a reasonable guess is to use the quarter-chord position
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{yz}(s) = 0.25\)</span>. For the arc positions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz(s)\)</span>, an
<a class="reference internal" href="derivations.html#elliptical-arc"><span class="std std-ref">Elliptical arc</span></a> can be defined using three parameters: two
for the normalized shape (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma_\textrm{tip}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_\textrm{tip}\)</span>) and one for the scale (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_\textrm{flat}\)</span>).
There are several ways to estimate the elliptical arc parameters of the
physical wing, such as the width to height ratios, or visual estimation of the
arc angle, but since the specs included both the flattened and projected spans,
the simplest method is to guess a value for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_\textrm{tip}\)</span> and
increase <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma_\textrm{tip}\)</span> until the projected span matches the
expected value. Starting with an initial guess of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_\textrm{tip}
= 75\)</span>, a few iterations shows good agreement with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma_\textrm{tip}
= 32\)</span>. Checking the fit shows a projected span of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b = 8.845\)</span> (versus the
true value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b = 8.840\)</span>) and a projected area of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S = 19.405\)</span>
(versus the true value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S = 19.550\)</span>). As with the flattened values,
the small discrepancy may be explained by differences in measurement
methodology, and likely isn’t worth optimizing further.</p>
<p>After the relatively straightforward process of positioning the sections is the
more difficult task of estimating their orientation. In the <a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html#simplified-model"><span class="std std-ref">simplified
model</span></a>, section roll <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi(s)\)</span> is
defined by the curvature of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz\)</span>-curve and the section yaw
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma(s)\)</span> is defined as zero, but the section pitch <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta(s)\)</span>
(or <em>geometric torsion</em>) can be difficult to determine (even with a physical
wing in hand). Relying on the fact that parafoils commonly benefit from a small
amount of increasing geometric torsion towards the wing tips (or <em>washin</em>),
a conservative guess of 4° at the wingtip should be reasonably accurate
<span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id15" title="Pere Casellas. Paraglider Design Handbook. http://laboratoridenvol.com/paragliderdesign/.">26</a>]</span>. For lack of better information, this

<p class="rubric" id="profiles">Profiles</p>
<p>Having finished defining the section layout (scale, position, and orientation),
each section must be assigned an airfoil <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id2" title="Ira H. Abbott and Albert E. Von Doenhoff. Theory of Wing Sections. Dover Publications, Inc., New York, USA, 1959. ISBN 978-0-486-60586-9.">2</a>]</span>.
The most accurate way to determine the section profiles would be to cut open
the wing and trace the outline of the internal ribs, but in this case that’s
not an option. Another option would be to search an airfoil database, but the
simplest approach is to use a choice from literature. When using literature,
it’s important to keep in mind that although papers discussing “parafoils” and
“ram-air parachutes” have much in common with paraglider canopies, those papers
are typically analyzing large canopies designed for heavy payloads.</p>
<p>From the ram-air category, <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id35" title="J Stephen Lingard. Ram-air parachute Design. In 13th AIAA Aerodynamic Decelerator Systems Technology Conference, 15–18. 1995.">27</a>]</span> observes
that many “older designs” use a Clark-Y airfoil with 18% thickness; it also
mentions that “newer gliders” have been design with “low-speed sections”, such
as the LS(1)-0417 (for example, see
<span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id9" title="Sarah Becker and Paul Bruce. Experimental Study of Paraglider Aerodynamics. Master's thesis, Imperial College London, September 2017. doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.33674.16321.">28</a>]</span>). For literature targeting
paragliders specifically, one option is the NACA 23015: a classic, general
purpose airfoil used in the wind tunnel <a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html#case-study"><span class="std std-ref">Case study</span></a>
<span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id10" title="Hervé Belloc. Wind tunnel investigation of a rigid paraglider reference wing. Journal of Aircraft, 52(2):703–708, 2015. doi:10.2514/1.C032513.">6</a>]</span>. Another paraglider-specific option
is the “Ascender”: an 18% thickness airfoil developed for an open-design
paraglider <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id15" title="Pere Casellas. Paraglider Design Handbook. http://laboratoridenvol.com/paragliderdesign/.">26</a>]</span>; for an example of
literature using that airfoil, see
<span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id14" title="Maurizio Boffadossi and Federico Savorgnan. Analysis on aerodynamic characteristics of a paraglider airfoil. AEROTECNICA, MISSILI E SPAZIO, 95(4):211–218, 2016. doi:10.19249/ams.v95i4.286.">29</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The criteria for selecting an airfoil is beyond the scope of this
demonstration, but a key observation is the tendency for paragliders to use
unusually thick airfoils. The reason for this is that thick airfoils tend to
have more gentle stall characteristics, since their low-curvature leading edges
encourage flow attachment as the angle of attack increases. Higher performance
wings may select thinner airfoils to reduce drag, because the Hook 3 is
a beginner-friendly wing this model uses a NACA 24018; it’s similar to the
23015 used by the wind tunnel model but with 18% thickness. (For the curious
reader, using the Ascender airfoil barely changes the equilibrium conditions
for the wing; small changes to the equilibrium pitch angles and a small
increase in the range of airspeeds, but otherwise the change had a surprisingly
small effect.)</p>
<p>After choosing an airfoil, the next step is to modify it support the brake
inputs. The unmodified airfoil defines the section profiles when no brakes are
applied, but a paraglider must deform those profiles in order to turn and slow
down. This poses a significant difficulty with modeling a paraglider, since the
deformation is a complex process. Unlike wings made from rigid materials with
fixed-hinge flaps, the brakes produce a continuous deformation along
variable-length sections of the profile. Instead of dealing with that
complexity, this project uses a strategy to simply guess the deflected
geometry.</p>
<p>To begin, observe that the trailing edge of a braking paraglider typically
exhibits a transition region followed by a gentle curve. In the interest of
practicality, model the transition and trailing regions as circular arc
segments. (This modeling choice is made with no theoretical justification
beyond the recognition that spherical shapes tend to appear as the
energy-minimizing state of a flexible surface under tension.) Because this is
not a theoretically well-justified model the algorithm will not be covered in
detail, but this “two-circle model” can be used to generate a set of deflected
airfoils.</p>

</figure>
<p>For the upper surface, first choose a point (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code>) at some distance from the
trailing edge (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code>) and attach a circle <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C2</span></code> tangent to the airfoil at
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> and replace the transition region of the airfoil with an arc from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code>
to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code>; then, place a second, larger, circle <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C1</span></code> tangent at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code> and draw
another arc for the remaining length of the upper curve. For the lower surface,
choose a point <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d</span></code> some distance roughly equal to the modified length of the
upper surface and use a Bézier curve to draw a deflected lower surface between
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d</span></code>, the new trailing edge <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code>, and the point where the deformed upper
surface curve crosses the original (undeformed) lower surface curve. The radius
of the smaller circle <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C2</span></code> controls the sharpness of the transition, and the
radius of the larger circle <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C1</span></code> controls the maximum steepness at the
trailing edge. This procedure maintains the length of the upper surface, but
neglects the wrinkling that normally occurs along the lower surface.</p>
<p>Using this procedure with the NACA 24018 as the baseline produces a set of
reasonable-looking curves:</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="airfoil-set-braking-naca24018">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At this point the reader should be highly skeptical of this airfoil set. The
choice of airfoil, and how the airfoil deforms in response to trailing edge
deflections, is full of assumptions. Nevertheless, these results will be used
for the remainder of this chapter as a means to demonstrate the working of the
model. As a result, an important thing to keep in mind when interpreting the
results of these choices is that choosing such a large radius for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C2</span></code> is
wildly optimistic, but was chosen anyway to reduce the curvature of the
transition region. For small brake inputs the transition curvature is
negligible, but becomes progressively sharper as deflection increases. High
curvature is a problem when using a theoretical aerodynamics model (such as
XFOIL) to estimate the section coefficients, since the high curvature inhibits
the method from converging on a solution when viscosity is taken into account.
Softening the curvature allows the estimate to converge, but at the cost of
hiding convergence failures that typically suggest flow separation. As
a result, this profile set is likely to overestimate lift and underestimate
drag.</p>

<p>In addition to a <a class="reference internal" href="foil_geometry.html"><span class="doc">foil geometry</span></a>, a canopy model requires

<p>In addition to the material densities, the canopy model requires the number of
cells to determine the distribution of mass for the internal ribs. The specs
lists <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_\textrm{cells} = 52\)</span>, which implies the wing has 53 ribs
(including the wing tips). In reality the ribs are <em>ported</em> (holes that allow
air to flow between cells) so assuming solid ribs is an overestimate, but since
the canopy model is neglecting the mass from the remainder of the internal
structure the discrepancy should (partially) balance out.</p>
<p>For the air intakes, the model must know the spanwise extent (since sections
near the wing tips typically do not include air intakes). The user manual
provides a projected diagram (Fig. 11.4, p. 17) which shows that the air
intakes start at the 21st of 26 ribs (the 27th “rib” in the diagram is part of
the stabilizer panel) spreading out from the central rib; assuming a linear
spacing of the ribs this would correspond to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = 0.807\)</span>, so
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_\textrm{end} = 0.8\)</span> is a reasonable guess.</p>
<p>The other dimension of the air intakes is the size of their opening, which is
determined by the extent of the upper and lower surface for each section
profile. This value is difficult to determine precisely from photos, but
thankfully its effect on the solid mass inertia and viscous drag is relatively
minor; in the absence of physical measurements, a reasonable guess is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_\textrm{upper} = -0.04\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_\textrm{lower} = -0.09\)</span> for an
air intake length roughly 5% of the length of the chord. For a related
discussion, see <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id14" title="Maurizio Boffadossi and Federico Savorgnan.

<p>At this point the canopy can compute the total mass, which is another
opportunity to sanity check the approximations. The technical specs list the
total wing weight at 4.9kg, but the canopy materials included in this model
only account for 2.95kg. This highlights the fact that the model neglects the
extra mass due to things like the lines, riser straps, carabiners, internal
v-ribs, horizontal straps, tension rods, etc. Fortunately, a significant amount
of that missing mass is near the system center of mass and does not impart
a major weight moment, so for the goals of this project the discrepancy is
assumed to have a negligible impact on the overall system behavior.</p>

<p>The first group of parameters <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#equation-suspension-lines-parameters-riser-position">(4.24)</a>
for the suspension line model determine the position of the harness (and pilot)
underneath the canopy as a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta_a\)</span>, the control input for
the <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#accelerator"><span class="std std-ref">Accelerator</span></a>.</p>
<p>Typically the most straightforward parameter to procure is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_z\)</span>:
the vertical distance from the riser midpoint to the canopy as a ratio of the
central chord <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_\textrm{root}\)</span>; for this wing, the technical specs
listed this value as the “Central line length” and can be used directly, so
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_z = \frac{6.8 \, [m]}{2.58 \, [m]} = 2.64\)</span>. Similarly, the accelerator
line length (the maximum amount the accelerator can decrease the length of the
central A lines) can also be read directly from the technical specs as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_a = 0.15 \, [m]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, the canopy connection positions of the A and C lines as fractions of the
central chord, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_C\)</span>, are frequently visible in
the line diagrams of the user manual; a quick measurement of the “Line plan”
diagram (Sec. 11.4, p. 17) suggests <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_A = 0.11\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_C
= 0.59\)</span>.</p>
<p>The remaining parameter, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_x\)</span>, determines the fore-aft position of
the riser midpoint. At first glance, this value can seem elusive, since it is
difficult to determine precisely using any of the data in the technical manual;
in fact, this value is also difficult to measure accurately from the physical
wing, diagrams, or pictures. However, a useful strategy is to simply delay
fixing the value of this parameter until the glider model is complete. The key
insight is to recognize how the position of the harness impacts the equilibrium
pitch angle of the wing, which in turn affects the equilibrium glide ratio of
the complete glider. A simple rule of thumb is that modern paragliders are
designed to maximize their glide ratio at “trim” conditions (that is, when no
controls are being used), so choosing a value for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_x\)</span> can be
accomplished iteratively by choosing the value that maximizes the glide ratio
with zero control inputs. If maximum glide requires braking, increase
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kappa_x\)</span>; if maximum glide requires accelerating, decrease
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kappa_x\)</span>. The exact value will depend on the type of harness and the
weight limit the designer was using as the optimization target, but
a reasonable starting point is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_x = 0.5\)</span>.</p>

<section id="brakes">
<h4><span class="section-number">7.1.3.2. </span>Brakes<a class="headerlink" href="#brakes" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The second group of parameters <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#equation-suspension-lines-parameters-brakes">(4.25)</a> for
the suspension line model determine how the trailing edge of the canopy is
deflected as a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left\{ \delta_{bl}, \delta_{br} \right\}\)</span>,
the control inputs for the <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#brakes"><span class="std std-ref">Brakes</span></a>.</p>
<p>The first four parameters determine how the deflection distribution develops
along the trailing edge as the brake lines are pulled. (Recall that the brake
distribution is centered about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_\textrm{start}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_\textrm{stop}\)</span>, which are interpolated between their zero- and
maximum-brake values.) Estimating these parameters starts by finding a view of
the trailing edge when brakes are being applied:</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="hook3-rear-view">
<img alt="_images/Hook3_rear_view.jpg" src="_images/Hook3_rear_view.jpg"/>
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 7.6 </span><span class="caption-text">Rear-view of an inflated Hook 3 with symmetric brake deflections</span><a class="headerlink" href="#hook3-rear-view" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First, the zero-brake values. From this picture the deflection appears to begin
near the middle of each semispan. Adding a symmetric margin softens the
distribution while keeping the starting point centered at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = 0.5\)</span>, so
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_{\textrm{start},0} = 0.3\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_{\textrm{stop},0} = 0.7\)</span> look
about right.</p>
<p>The maximum-brake values are more difficult, since they must coordinate with
the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_b\)</span>, but from [[FIXME: link to the youtube video]] it
can be seen that maximum brakes produce a deflection from roughly
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_{\textrm{start},1} = 0.08\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_{\textrm{stop},1} = 1.05\)</span>
(where the stopping position exceeds the wing tip to indicate that the wing tip
itself experiences a small deflection).</p>
<p>Next, the model needs the maximum distance the brake lines can be pulled. On
a real wing the brake lines effectively don’t have a well-defined limit, since
a pilot can literally wrap the brake lines around their hand to pull the
trailing edge all the way back to the risers, but in practice the airfoil set
<a class="reference internal" href="#airfoil-set-braking-naca24018"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7.4</span></a> that defines the deflected profiles is
limited to some maximum deflection distance. For that reason, the
<a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#suspension-lines"><span class="std std-ref">Suspension lines</span></a> model uses brake inputs on
a scale from 0 to 1, with a maximum brake deflection distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_b\)</span>.
The value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_b\)</span> should maximize the usable range of the brakes
without causing the normalized deflection distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\delta}_d\)</span>
<a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#equation-normalized-deflection-distance">(4.1)</a> of any section to exceed the distance
supported by the airfoil set. Written as an optimization in terms of <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#equation-total-brake-deflections">(4.14)</a>, the goal is to calculate the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_b\)</span> such
that:</p>
<div class="math-wrapper"><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\max_s \frac {\delta_d(s, 1, 1)} {c(s)} = \bar{\delta}_{d,\textrm{max}}\]</div></div>
<p>Checking the airfoil set used for this model (<a class="reference internal" href="#airfoil-set-braking-naca24018"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7.4</span></a>), define <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\delta}_{d,\textrm{max}} = 0.203\)</span>. Solving the
optimization problem determines <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_b = 0.426 \, [m]\)</span>. This procedure
is unfortunately convoluted, but in summary: for this specific airfoil set, the

<p>The third group of parameters <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#equation-suspension-lines-parameters-aerodynamics">(4.26)</a>
for the suspension line model determine the aerodynamic drag of the lines.
Because the model is focused on providing functionality instead of a detailed
(and tedious) layout of every line, it computes the drag by lumping the total
area of the lines into a small number of points. For this demonstration,
satisfactory results can be achieved with just two points (one for each
semispan) and crude estimates of the true line area distribution.</p>
<p>First, the total line length for this wing is listed directly in the technical
specs, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_L = 218 \, [m]\)</span>. Next, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_L\)</span> must be multiplied
by the average diameter of the lines <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_d\)</span> to get their total
surface area. Although a complete set of diameters for each line segment are
given in the “Lines Technical Data” section, computing an accurate distribution
would require their detailed layout; instead, with lower sections of the
cascade averaging <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.8 \, [mm]\)</span> and upper sections using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.6 \,
[mm]\)</span> lines, a good starting point is to assume an average diameter of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_d = 1 \, [mm]\)</span>. Next, the area is divided into the two control
points, which must be positioned at the area centroids of their group of lines.
For an approximate model such as this, the positions of the points are easiest
to estimate visually; using <a class="reference internal" href="#hook3-rear-view"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7.6</span></a> they appear to be around
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{r}_{CP/R} = \left&lt; -0.5 c_\textrm{root}, ±1.75, 1.75 \right&gt;\)</span>.
Lastly, each lumped line area is assigned a drag coefficient; because the lines
are essentially cylinders, a suitable drag coefficient is simply <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{d,l}
= 1\)</span> <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id32" title="Robert Kulhánek.

<section id="payload">
<h3><span class="section-number">7.1.4. </span>Payload<a class="headerlink" href="#payload" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The final component model of the paraglider system is for the <a class="reference internal" href="paraglider_components.html#harness"><span class="std std-ref">harness</span></a>. This component is responsible for positioning
the mass of the payload (harness and pilot) as a function of weight-shift, and
computing the aerodynamic drag applied to the payload.</p>
<p>The parameters of the model are the total mass of the payload (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_p\)</span>),
the vertical distance of the mass centroid below the riser midpoint
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z_\textrm{riser}\)</span>), the cross-sectional area of the payload
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_\textrm{payload}\)</span>), the aerodynamic drag coefficient
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{d,\textrm{payload}}\)</span>), and the maximum horizontal distance a pilot
can displace the centroid using weight-shift control (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_w\)</span>).</p>
<p>For the total mass, the technical specs list the weight range for the size 23
wing as 65–85 [kg], so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_p = 75 \left[\textrm{kg}\right]\)</span> is
a conservative choice.</p>
<p>For the mass centroid, one option is to consider the DHV airworthiness
guidelines <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id51" title="Peter Wild. Airworthiness requirements for hanggliders and paragliders. 2009.">30</a>]</span>, which specify
that the riser attachment points must be “35–65cm above the seat board”, which
suggests that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z_\textrm{riser} = 0.5 \left[\textrm{m}\right]\)</span> is
a reasonable value in most cases. Alternatively, simply look up the technical
diagram of a suitable harness; for example, the wing certification flight tests
(published in the Hook 3 User Manual, p. 22) list the “harness to risers
distance” as 49cm.</p>
<p>For the surface area and its associated drag coefficient, consider
<span id="id11">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id11" title="Diego Muniz Benedetti. Paragliders Flight Dynamics. PhD thesis, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, 2012.">5</a>]</span> (p. 85) or
<span id="id12">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id6" title="Holger Babinsky. The aerodynamic performance of paragliders. The Aeronautical Journal (1968), 103(1027):421–428, 1999. doi:10.1017/S0001924000027974.">21</a>]</span> (p. 422); given that 75kg
is a lower-than-average payload (so smaller frontal area), and that this is
a beginner-grade wing (so a high performance “pod” harness is less likely),
a reasonable choice of the area would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_\textrm{payload} = 0.55
\left[\textrm{m}^2\right]\)</span> with an drag coefficient of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{d,\textrm{payload}} = 0.8\)</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, when choosing a weight shift limit, underestimates are preferable to
overestimates, since an underestimate merely limits the range of behavior the
model can produce, whereas an overestimate can produce fictitious behavior; in
the absence of a rigorous measurement, a conservative guess is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_w
= 0.15 \left[\textrm{m}\right]\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">7.2. </span>Model validation<a class="headerlink" href="#model-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Having defined the parameters for the three component models, they are combined
into a composite <a class="reference internal" href="system_dynamics.html"><span class="doc">System dynamics</span></a> model that provides the behavior of the
complete glider. Getting to this point with such little information required
many modeling assumptions, simplifications, approximations, and outright
guesswork. The natural next step is to question the validity of the model: how
accurately does it estimate the true behavior of the physical system? In any
modeling project it is vital to validate the model by comparing its estimates
to experimental data, and this case is no exception.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, experimental data is extremely scarce for commercial paraglider
wings. Unlike the aerodynamics <a class="reference internal" href="foil_aerodynamics.html#case-study"><span class="std std-ref">case study</span></a>, wind tunnel measurements are unavailable. What’s worse, the dynamic
behavior of a wing in motion is significantly more complex than the static
behavior of a wing held fixedly in a wind tunnel. As a result, we must make do
with point data and general expectations gleaned from sources such as glider
certifications and consumer wing reviews. Clearly such sources lack the rigor
to “prove” model accuracy, a fact that may be disheartening after all the work
thus far. Nevertheless, when taken together they can at least provide
incremental confidence that a model is adequate to answer basic questions of
wing performance.</p>
<section id="polar-curve">
<h3><span class="section-number">7.2.1. </span>Polar curve<a class="headerlink" href="#polar-curve" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The conventional way to summarize the performance of a gliding aircraft is with
a chart called the <em>polar curve</em>. These curves show the vertical and horizontal
speed of the aircraft at equilibrium over the range of brake and accelerator
inputs, providing information such as the usable range of the glider and its
glide ratio at different ground speeds. Given the wealth of information
compactly communicated by a polar curve, they are an excellent starting point
for critiquing the estimates of a flight dynamics model for a glider.</p>
<p>The previous section demonstrated the creation of a paraglider model for
a Niviuk Hook 3, size 23. Now, models for the larger sizes of the wing (created
using the same workflow) will be compared to experimental data by comparing
measurements from test flights to the predicted polar curves.</p>
<section id="size-25">
<h4><span class="section-number">7.2.1.1. </span>Size 25<a class="headerlink" href="#size-25" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>For the experimental data, a size 25 version of the wing was reviewed for the
French magazine “Parapente Mag” [[FIXME: citation; see <cite>Hook 3 Parapente Mag
148.pdf</cite>]].</p>
<p>Unfortunately, reviews such as this cannot provide the entire polar curve;
because each point is laborious to measure accurately, reviews only provide
noteworthy values, such as the minimum and maximum speeds, or the horizontal
and vertical speeds that mark the “minimum sink” and “best glide” operating
points of the glider. Despite this ambiguity, by plotting the experimental
point data over the theoretical curve it is possible to get a sense of the
general accuracy of the model estimates.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The minimum ground speed of the theoretical model is significantly higher
than the experimental value. That may be explained by the conservative value
of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_b = 0.44 \, [m]\)</span> (the maximum distance the brakes can be
pulled; see the earlier discussion when defining the parameters for the
<a class="reference internal" href="#brakes"><span class="std std-ref">Brakes</span></a>). The review listed the maximum brake length as
&gt;60cm, which suggests that this model can only apply &lt;73% of the full range
of brakes, so this result in unsurprising.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum sink occurs at about 0.4 m/s slower ground speed. This may be related
to the procedure to generate the deflected <a class="reference internal" href="#profiles">Profiles</a>, to the deflection
distribution, or to the aerodynamic coefficient estimates from XFOIL.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum sink rate is remarkably close (1.06 versus 1.02 m/s), which I find
surprising since I expected the “optimistic” airfoil set <a class="reference internal" href="#airfoil-set-braking-naca24018"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7.4</span></a> to overestimate lift during braking.</p></li>
<li><p>The theoretical model underestimates the ground speed at trim. Although this
could be due to it overestimating the drag, it is far more likely that the
model is overestimating the lift of the wing, so less speed is required to
counteract the weight of the glider.</p></li>
<li><p>This experimental data reported the best glide at 10.4 m/s when trim was 10.6
m/s. This disagrees with our earlier assumption that best glide should occur
at trim.</p></li>
<li><p>The model overestimates the maximum ground speed. This may suggest it is
underestimating drag, or it could suggest that the model parameters are wrong
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa_C\)</span> in particular has a large impact on maximum speed), or it
could be because this rigid body model neglects foil deformations (it assumes
the accelerator produces a perfect pitch-rotation of the foil) as well as the
section profile deformations that increase with speed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, these observations are just a drop in the bucket of possible issues
with the theoretical model (not to mention issues with the experimental data
itself); there are so many simplifications at work, and point data cannot hope
to reveal all their flaws. These results suggest that the performance of the
model is excellent when predicting longitudinal equilibrium, but a wider
variety of wing models need to be examined to determine if this excellence
generalizes to other wings.</p>

the usable “&gt;60cm” brake length, so the minimum ground speed is still too high.
And again, the model underestimates the ground speed at trim. The best glide
ratio matches exactly, although the theoretical model still slightly
underestimates the ground speed where that occurs.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.3.1. </span>Drag breakdown<a class="headerlink" href="#drag-breakdown" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>A common question for curious pilots is how to reduce the drag of their glider
so they can improve the glide ratio or top speed of their wing. The natural
progression of this curiosity is wonder where all the drag comes from in the
first place. One way to answer that question is to plot the drag contributions
from each component <span id="id13">[<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#id5" title="Holger Babinsky. Aerodynamic improvements of paraglider performance. In 17th Applied Aerodynamics Conference, 3148. 1999.">31</a>]</span>.</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 7.11 </span><span class="caption-text">Drag breakdown for Niviuk Hook 3 23 with a pod harness.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id19" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Viscous drag includes effects such as the sheer forces produced by the
viscosity of the air, and the pressure drag due to flow separation (the
“vacuum” that can occur on the downwind side of an object); these forms of drag
occur on every surface of the glider, including the lines and payload. Inviscid
drag is less intuitive: commonly referred to as “lift-induced drag”, it is the
energy lost in the vorticity that the wing sheds into its wake as a side-effect
of producing lift.</p>
<p>This diagram provides a satisfying look into the behavior of a wing across the
range of speeds. At the low end, pilots understand that the “brakes” will slow
the wing by increasing its drag, but may be surprised to discover that the
increase in drag is dominated by how the wing produces lift. At the high end,
it can be surprising to learn what proportion of the total system drag is
produced by the seemingly-negligible suspension lines. Although drag is just
one piece of the lift/drag ratio, this sort of breakdown is valuable for
estimating how much improvement is possible by (for example) reducing the drag
of the payload.</p>
<p>This decomposition is also educational because it offers another perspective of
how each component of the wing affects the overall design. Consider the general
guideline that paraglider wings are designed to achieve their maximum glide
ratio at “trim” (zero controls), which usually coincides with the speed that
minimizes the total system drag (as seen here). Now suppose the design was
changed; for example, increasing the aspect ratio of the canopy will tend to
decrease its lift-induced drag, which in turn requires repositioning the
payload at trim. The complete system behavior is a complex interaction of
components, and having access to a parametric model such as this is an
excellent resource for quickly answering questions about glider efficiency by
developing an intuition of how their interactions affect the system behavior.</p>
