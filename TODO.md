 * Write an outline
 * Write an introduction
 * Outline the atmospheric estimation process
 * Write an intro to particle filtering: high-level overview (simulations into best guesses)

 * Flowchart the processing pipeline: observations -> states, parameters, constraint factors
    * Nodes are functions (filter, transition, etc)


## Editorial Tasks
 * Terminology/Semantics
    * What markup style should I use for terms/definitions? (bold?)
 * What sections should have PDF bookmarks?
    * Use `\currentpdfbookmark{label}{bookmarkname}`
 * Appendices only need a single `\appendix` call; how to organize the TOC?
