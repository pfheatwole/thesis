Conclusion
**********

.. "The conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that we posted
   at the end of the context section."

   So "results" doesn't belong here at all. This is a discusson revolving
   around the results.

.. What are the results of this project?

   Assume an impatient reader will jump here. This is your last chance to
   convince them the paper is worth reading.


* This paper started by creating a foil geometry with enough flexibility to
  enable complex foil models to be defined using parametric functions. Modeling
  a canopy then becomes a problem of designing suitable parametric functions
  and estimating the parameters that best describe the true geometry.

* [[developed a foil geometry with enough flexibility to enable complex foil
  models to be defined using parametric functions which encode the assumptions
  of the missing structure.]]

* Modeling a canopy then becomes a problem of designing suitable parametric
  functions and estimating the parameters that best describe the true
  geometry.


Summary?
========

* This is an engineering paper, not a research paper. It's about implementing
  solutions/tools/models, not answering questions.

  This should summarize how well the project addressed the need defined by the
  introduction. I said I wanted to use basic specs to produce paraglider flight
  dynamics models; did I succeed?

* You can use this to learn about wing behavior. For example, the effect of the
  riser midpoint: how to changes the polar curves, control authority, etc.

* Although the design was focused on paragliders, the decomposition should be
  easily adaptable to other gliding aircraft such as hang gliders or kites.

* The implementation is available under a permissive open source license.

* A parametric geometry and a dynamics model in Python. Includes several state
  models and simulator.

* Derivations available in appendices.

* Modular system design (doesn't simplify the equations by merging the
  components; each component is independent, as much as reasonable possible)

* Code available on Github using open source libraries

  * Why Python?

    * Approachable syntax

    * Good cross-domain language

    * Free (unlike matlab)

    * Numerical libraries (numpy, scipy)

    * Large library ecosystem (s2sphere, sklearn, databases, PyMC3, pandas, etc)

    * Easy integration into tools w/ native support (Blender, FreeCAD, QGIS)

      * Generate a simulation directly inside Blender

      * Design a wing and estimate it's polar curve inside FreeCAD

* Developed entirely using freely available tools (XFLR5, AVL, etc) and open
  source libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc)

* The entire work is under permissive licensing: code is MIT, text and figures
  are CC-BY


Future work
===========



Freewrite
=========

* The motivating problem for this project was the need for a distribution of
  dynamics models over commercial paraglider wings to enable paraglider flight
  reconstruction.

* To facilitate the creation of paraglider dynamics models, it developed
  a novel foil geometry that [[made it feasible to define]] design curves that
  are parametrized by the [[most easily available public data]].

* It also implemented an aerodynamics method that is well suited for the
  variety of nonlinearities involved with analyzing paraglider dynamics. It
  then modified the method to significantly improve its performance when used
  for sequential flight simulation (faster convergence, approximately handle
  non-uniform wind vectors (such as during wing rotations), more stable during
  wing rotations (clamped coefficients), etc).

* In additional to the parametric foil geometry, it also decomposed the system
  model into three components (canopy, lines, and payload) and implemented
  parametric models for them.

* It implemented several system dynamics models that combine the component
  models, and account for the effects of apparent mass.

* It concluded by implementing state dynamics models and a flight simulator
  for generating state trajectories.

* To demonstrate its effectiveness, it implemented a commercial wing (a Niviuk
  Hook 3, size 23) using only publicly available data, then compared its
  static and dynamic performance to experimental flight performance.
