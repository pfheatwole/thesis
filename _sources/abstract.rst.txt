.. Remember: "Tell a complete story in the abstract."

Dynamic simulations are invaluable for studying system behavior, developing
control models, and running statistical analyses. For example, paraglider
flight simulations could be used to analyze how a wing behaves when it
encounters wind shear, or to reconstruct the wind field that was present during
a flight. Unfortunately, creating dynamics models for commercial paraglider
wings is difficult: not only are detailed specifications unavailable, but even
if they were a detailed model would be laborious to create. To address that
difficulty, this project decomposes a paraglider system into a set of
parametric component models that can approximate paraglider flight dynamics
using incomplete technical specifications and knowledge of typical wing design.
[[An implementation of the models is available as an `open source library
<https://github.com/pfheatwole/glidersim>`__ built on the Python scientific
computing stack.]]

   The models estimate the inertia and aerodynamics from scratch!
