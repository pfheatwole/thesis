Explorations of Style
*********************

These notes summarize a set of posts from "Explorations of Style", a blog that
concentrates on graduate-level writing guidelines. Its primary points relate
to principles for writing and strategies for clear communication.

It's also useful to recognize the difference between the three distinct phases
of writing: drafting, revision, and proofreading. *Drafting* is about
generating the content, the "raw materials" of your document. *Revision* is
the active reading and rearranging of the text. *Proofreading* is strictly the
correction of errors.

Many of the points are not novel, but very well clarified and formalized. This
formalization is helpful for converting an ad hoc process into a systematic
process. It is invaluable to have a concrete recognition of what works, what
isn't working, and how to approach the revision process.

A good starting point for these notes:

Three Key Principles
====================

They chose **three key principles** for how an author should approach writing:

1. Use writing to clarify your own thinking

2. Commit to extensive revision

3. Understand the needs of your reader


Writing to clarify your own thinking
------------------------------------

"If we cannot decide what we want to say without writing and if we believe
that we cannot write without a solid idea about what we want to say, we are in
an obvious bind. For most of us, the best way out of this dilemma is to
write."

The key to avoiding this mental block is to acknowledge that you are producing
a "provisional text" whose purpose is to help put some potential topics on
paper. The key is to trust in your revision strategies (reverse outlining,
etc) and just start writing.


Revision
--------

Revision needs to be both *systematic* (so you can apply it consistently, and
without having to rethink it all the time) and *thorough* (so you don't miss
some editorial issues). **A systematic revision strategy gives the writer
confidence that they can fix the issues that inevitably appear.**

Revision is different from proofreading. **Revision** is the active reading
and rearranging of the text; **proofreading** is the process of making
corrections and checking for consistency (while *not* making revision changes
that can introduce new errors!)

Think of your existing content as "raw material": it's the basis from which
you can build a better text. Learn to look past its existing shape, and focus
on those raw materials.

"Good revisers are better writers because they have the confidence to know
that they can fix the problems that are inevitably created during the
composition process."

Two complimentary methods for checking structural cohesion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Reverse outline

  Build an outline using numbered topic sentences from each paragraph,
  reorganize the numbers to improve the text structure, then reorganize the
  paragraphs according to their reordered numbers

  Helps you **find structural problems**.

* Topic sentence paragraphs

  Copy the topic sentence from each paragraph into a new pseudo-paragraph,
  then try to read it. This technique isn't helpful until you suspect the text
  is structurally coherent, but it is useful for confirming that suspicion.

  Helps you **confirm structural cohesion**.

Put another way, the *reverse outline* shows what's **wrong**, whereas the
*topic sentence paragraph* confirms what's **right**.


Some activities that can be described as revision
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Word choice: is the vocabulary appropriate?

* sentence structure: are the sentences easy for the reader to follow?

* transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and sections: is the ordering
  optimal, and have you signalled that order to the reader?

* Tone: have you engaged the reader while still conforming to academic writing
  conventions?

* Economy: have you avoided distracting digressions or general wordiness?

* Overall coherence: is there a clear and discernible argument or structure to
  your writing?


Coarse-to-Fine Issue Ordering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is helpful to recognize the different broader issues you will encounter,
and create a **sequence** for dealing with them. For example, the author
suggests this ordering:

1. Broad structural issues

   Start with the big issues. The most effective strategy for structural
   revision is the reverse outline.

   This stage should be ruthless. Some things may have been necessary to be
   *written* (so you can clear up the idea in your head) but not necessary to
   be *read*. Is it useful to the reader? If not, cut it.

   Also important is to remember: **Content that may have been necessary in an
   old draft may no longer be serving a purpose in the edited text.** It might
   be good to sequester these sections elsewhere until you can verify if
   they're truly valuable.

2. Clarity
   
   Eliminate unnecessary words and undue complexity. Writers are often tempted
   to distance themselves from their ideas with awkward expressions, weak
   verbs, and unclear subjects.

3. Sentence-level errors

   Subject-verb agreement, ambiguous references (unclear "this", etc), and
   punctuation

4. Cohesion problems

   All the previous changes are likely to introduce new cohesion problems.
   This is a good time to review the **topic sentence paragraphs** to make
   sure the text flows naturally.

This method of focusing on specific issues also encourages time efficient
reviews: **don't try to fix all types of issues at once**. For example, by the
time you're to the proof reading stage you probably don't to keep fiddling
with document structure (which is likely to introduce new errors). **Be strict
about what type of revision you're doing.**


General Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Revising your own text can be difficult because you know what you're trying to
say. It is easy to get into a rhythm of simply *reading* while you're supposed
to be *revising*. There are different strategies for breaking out of this sort
of reverie:

* Let time elapse. Allowing yourself time to forget what you were trying to
  say can reveal poorly written sections.

* Try reading the text aloud.

* Read paragraphs out of order. It is easy to get distracted with the
  underlying ideas of a section instead of how they are written, so focusing
  on isolated paragraphs might reveal cohesion issues *inside* each paragraph.

  It's worth repeating that local coherence should be done after checking for
  global coherence. If the reverse outline reveals global coherence issues,
  fix those first, even if it means temporarily sacrificing local cohesion.

* Stop at the end of each paragraph. Instead of allowing yourself to get into
  a complacent rhythm, force yourself to explicitly stop and acknowledge
  whether you have actually edited a paragraph before you move on.

* Edit in stages. Choose a set of specific issues, and fix the broadest issues
  first. This does require revising the document several times, but it has two
  advantages. First, it reduces the mental overhead of trying to fix several
  issues simultaneously. Second, premature fine editing not only wastes time
  (if the content must change due to broader issues), but your efforts can
  also lead to feelings of a "sunk cost" that make you unwilling to change
  that section again.

* Economy matters: phrases should always be doing important work


The Needs of Your Reader
------------------------

* Clear metadiscourse; consistent signposting

* Avoid "hedging"

* Exude confidence that the reader can grasp the topic: it is my job to make
  it clear, and yes, the topic can be clearly communicated, whatever it is.

* Avoid "the curse of knowledge": don't lose track of what the *reader* needs
  to know

* "Readers are entitled to a one-way trip through a piece of writing"

  "U-turn signs: vague pronoun reference; unclear use of ordinals; failure to
  consistently use core terminology; withholding a verb till the very end of
  a sentence; listing without alerting the reader that you are doing so;
  relying heavily on devices such as ‘aforementioned’, ‘former/latter’, or
  ‘respectively’. All of these practices can send readers backwards, denying
  them their best chance at a one-way trip through your writing."


Metadiscourse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A simple description of metadiscourse is simply "writing about writing"
(versus writing about the topic).

A more nuanced description is from Hyland and Tse: "[Metadiscourse is] the
range of devices writers use to explicitly *organize their texts*, *engage
readers*, and *signal their attitudes* to both their material and their
audience." There should be a three-way relationship between the *text*, the
*reader*, and the *author*. The author should be "present" in the text: that
includes not only presenting the topic, but also discussing the **text**; help
the reader understand the structure of the text, how the content relates to
the reader, and your opinions/attitudes as the author.

There are several things you can signal to the reader:

* How the text is organized

* How ideas are related

* How evidence is being used

* How an idea will be re-examined or further explained

* How much strength the author attributes to a particular claim or result

* Personal opinions (eg, "this achievement" vs "this *remarkable*
  achievement", or "this is problematic" vs "this is *particularly*
  problematic")

* The frame of mind the author expects from the reader

  For example, "It is widely recognized that..." signals your stance on the
  matter, so the reader knows how to interpret what is about to follow.

  Another example: "This claim raises an obvious question" signals to the
  reader that you're addressing what you believe to be a glaring issue.

* How the text reflects the authors role:

  * "My use of the term ..."

  * "I will attempt to..."

It can be helpful to review your use of of these signals. The author presented
four questions to challenge and encourage growth in using metadiscourse, and
recommends dedicating some revision time to asking these questions:

* If we are using some sorts of metadiscourse *routinely*, are we doing it
  well?
  
* If we are *avoiding* some sorts of metadiscourse, can we deepen our
  understanding of the norms of academic writing to be sure this judgement is
  based on a sound understanding of disciplinary practice?
  
* If we are using some sorts of metadiscourse *hesitantly or inexpertly*,
  could we improve our understanding of the value of such devices for the
  reader and thus overcome our reservations?
  
* Lastly, if we are under-using some sorts of metadiscourse because we *lack
  a sufficiently deep understanding of our own text*, can we learn how to
  develop that understanding in order to meet the reader’s need for guidance
  through our text?

*Signposting* is the element of metadiscourse that manages the reader's
expectations by signaling how the document is structured. This is important
anywhere structure exists and would be helpful to be made explicit. However,
signposting *what* you're going to do isn't as helpful as first communicating
*why* the *what* is necessary. Consider "I will discuss particle filtering."
versus "Recreating the flight requires filling in missing pieces; this type of
artificial data generation is known as simulation-based filtering. One such
method is the particle filter."

Metadiscourse can even be helpful to the writer: similar to scaffolding,
declaring your intent ("I will...") can guide your own thinking, but may be
removed or refined after serving its purpose.



Five Key Strategies
===================

They chose **five key strategies** for accomplishing clear communication:

1. Expose the internal structure of a piece of writing by creating a *reverse
   outline*

2. Treat *paragraphs as the fundamental unit of discourse*

3. Use *effective transitions* between sentences, paragraphs, and sections

4. Express the actions in your sentences with *strong verbs*

5. Use the "characters" in your sentences as *clear subjects*


Reverse Outline
---------------

The reverse outline is a strategy for separating *structural* revision from
*content*-level revision. You **move the analysis to a higher level of
abstraction so you don't get lost in the details.**

The steps to creating a reverse outline:

1. Number the paragraphs

   Paragraphs are the most basic unit of composition. Numbering them directs
   attention away from sentences, and onto the structure induced by the
   paragraphs.

2. Identify the topic of each paragraph

   This will be challenging in early drafts because many paragraphs will not
   have clear topics, and not all topics will be expressed neatly in a single
   paragraph.

   "It is crucial to remember that you are trying to make evident what *is*
   there rather than what *ought* to be there."

   This is a *diagnostic* step: you are **observing** rather than judging or
   remedying. "You are simply noting what each paragraph was trying to do, for
   better or for worse."

3. Arrange the topics into an outline

   Create a list of the topics, paragraph by paragraph. "The crucial thing at
   this stage is to leave your original text along and work just on the
   outline." You will use these topics to see past the details and reveal the
   *essential structure* of the text.

4. Analyze the outline
   
   "Pay particular attention to the logic and proportionality of the internal
   organization. Understanding the logic involves observing the way elements
   have been placed in relation to one another. Understanding the
   proportionality involves observing how much space is being devoted to each
   element. This step is the bridge between *noting what you have* and *preparing
   to create something new*.

5. Create a revised outline
   
   You now know more about the text you're writing than when you started. Use
   that new understanding to develop a new **abstract** structure for the
   document. This higher level of abstraction lets you avoid getting bogged
   down in the details. This is crucial when you're trying to wrap your head
   around a large text.

6. Reorganize the text according to the revised outline

   **This is the first time you actually change the original text.**
   
   At this point, you are only changing the structure by *reordering* the
   content; do not *change* the content yet.

   Do not get distracted by the fact that the sections no longer nest as
   intended. This step is not for editing the content, only the ordering.

7. Check for topic sentences and cohesion
   
   **This is the first time you change the content itself!**
   
   Because of the blind reordering, it is likely that the text will have lost
   some cohesion. This is where you resume examining issues such as word
   choice, sentence structure, transitions, tone, economy, and overall
   coherence.


Paragraphs
----------

"A paragraph is the fundamental unit of discourse." Paragraphs provide the
structural basis for the text as a whole, and each one should make a distinct
contribution. They usually need a **topic sentence** that capture the essence
of that contribution. The remaining sentences should be *thematically linked*
to the theme announced in the topic sentence. Length should be determined by
content, not the number of sentences or space required on the page.

One of the reasons reverse-outlines are so effective is that they use topic
sentences as their fundamental units of analysis, which directly correspond to
the contribution of each paragraph.


Transitions
-----------

Key principles to help create clear transitions:

1. Avoid unclear references
   
   For example "A is connected to B. This is..." versus "A is connected to B.
   This *connection* is..." This pattern is `this <summary word>`, where the
   summary word makes the "this" reference explicit.

2. Avoid unnecessary transition words
   
   Problematic transition words tend to be those that indicate an additional
   idea: "in addition", "also", "moreover", etc. While it is possible that the
   addition may deepen a claim (eg, "furthermore"), if it only serves to say
   "here comes another point" it is probably unnecessary. If you really need
   a link, remove vague transitions like "also" and look for a more
   substantive indication of the link.

3. Avoid the mere *appearance* of causality
   
   Causal words ("therefore", "thus", "hence") should be used sparingly, and
   only in cases of direct causal relationships.

4. Use transition words to indicate a change in the direction of your text
   
   If you've been building up a topic, but then want to take it in a different
   direction, make that change in direction obvious: "<buildup>. *However*,
   I disagree."

There are also **paragraph transitions** and **transitions between sections**.

* **sentence transitions**: tend to be `this + summary word`

* **paragraph transition**:  tend to be `this + summary phrase`

  Be careful with words like "however", "in other words" etc, at the start of
  a paragraph: starting a paragraph with these types of phrases tend to
  confuse the reader and lead to "u-turn" behavior.

* **section transitions**: can be at the start of a section, the end, or
  wherever an overall structure is created.

  "For example, in a literature review, a writer may say that she is going to
  consider the literature on a certain topic from three perspectives. The
  reader will then be fine with three independent sections without explicit
  transitions between them."

  **Transitions should happen in the text, not in the headings.** As a rule
  of thumb, read through section (and subsection) headings as if they weren't
  there.


Verbs
-----

If a sentence has an action, it should be expressed by a strong verb, not
a noun.

Example: "Our uncertainty precluded determination of..." versus "Because of
our uncertainty, we could not determine...". The noun "determination" is
a wrapper around the verb describing the action, "determine".

.. TODO expound. Add examples of "strong verbs"


Subjects
--------

If a sentence has an action, it should be clear who is performing it.

It's often helpful to think of sentences as having "characters"; you reframe
the writing as story telling. Once you know the character of a sentence, use
them as the subjects of strong verbs.

.. TODO expound. Add example of "clear subjects"


Drafting
========

"We write the first draft for ourselves; the drafts thereafter increasingly
for the reader."


Meta-Analysis of Drafts
-----------------------

A draft is a sketch of a final text. Once you have created a draft, you must
decide whether to continue on to the revision stage. For example, when the
author of Explorations of Style is deciding whether a draft is worthy of
turning into a blog post, she looks at three aspects of the early draft:

1. Assessment of *relevance*: does the topic appear worth sharing with your
   target audience? Perhaps the draft was merely for clarifying the idea in
   her own head, and has served its purpose.

2. Assessment of *coherence*: does the content flow well?

3. Assessment of *manageability*: the draft will require revision; can you
   establish a path to completion?

Reference: https://explorationsofstyle.com/2016/01/20/revising-out-loud/


Introductions
=============

The standard model for structuring introductions uses three "moves":

1. Context
   
   What your audience needs to know in order to understand the problem you are
   going to confront. May act as a refresher, or even a primer, to the topic,
   but will not discuss new material.

2. Problem (and Significance)
   
   What you want to accomplish, and why it will matter to have done so. The
   mere existence of a problem isn't sufficient, you should establish the
   motivation for your upcoming work.

3. Response
   
   What you are actually going to do in your research to address the problem.

Using this structure is effective because **it tells the reader what they need
to know**, not just a wandering story of your own thought process. It is
methodical in setting up the reader's understanding of the text. This explicit
breakdown can also reveal underdeveloped ideas.

If you pay attention to your text, you should see these *moves* throughout
your text. For example, a literature review can be seen as a deeper iteration
of the **context**. Each section of your thesis will likely fall under one of
these categories, and recognizing those categorizations can help guide your
writing.


Thesis Introductions
--------------------

Because a thesis is such a large body of work, it can require special
considerations. The reader should not have to wait for a complete and thorough
context before they hear the problem. You may want to start with a big picture
version of the three moves. An **introduction to the introduction**, if you
will. This can be as little as three paragraphs preceding the full context.

For example, your introduction might be structured as follows:

1. Introduction to the introduction
   
   This primes the reader for the context, so they'll be on the lookout for
   the salient points of the problem.

2. Context

3. Restatement of the problem
   
   Your big picture problem description was probably vague, but now that
   you've established a more detailed context you can elaborate on the finer
   points of the problem.

4. Restatement of the response
   
   Same deal as before: leverage the detail presented in the full context to
   elaborate on the details of the response.

5. Roadmap
   
   A brief indication of how the thesis will proceed.

*A good introduction will serve to make the reader feel comfortable
with the document as soon as possible. It should imbue the reader with a sense
of familiarity.* A good introduction lowers the cognitive overhead necessary
to understand the body by setting clear expectations.


Miscellaneous Notes
===================


Commas
------

Six things the Explorations of Style author wishes people remembered about
commas:

1. Understanding coordinating conjunctions in crucial to understand using
   commas in compound sentences.

2. A comma must be more than a knee-jerk response to the length of a sentence.
   Think about the purpose of the comma (it might help to remove it and see
   what function is was providing).

3. Commas come in two varieties when adding additional or parenthetical
   information to a sentence: solitary, and paired. Solitary commas are when
   the extra information is at the beginning or end of the sentence, pairs
   occur when the "interruption" is placed in the middle. Using only half of
   a pair of commas creates confusion. 

4. Understanding restrictive and non-restrictive elements (integral versus
   supplementary clauses) is essential to using commas well.

5. Comma usage can be influenced by the conventions of your discipline.

6. The decision of whether to use a serial commas (aka, an Oxford commas)
   should not be taken lightly.


Coordinating Conjunctions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An *independent clause* is a group of words containing a subject and a verb
that can stand alone as a sentence. A *compound sentence* is a sentence
composed of at least two independent clauses.

There seven words that can function as *coordinating conjunctions*: and, but,
so, or, nor, for, and yet (**FANBOYS**). Only those seven words can lead to
the compound-sentence-with-comma pattern. A *comma splice* is a compound
sentence with a comma but no coordinating conjunction. Although coordinating conjunctions are strong enough to complete the compound
sentence without a comma, the comma can decrease ambiguity.

A related error is to use a comma to separate independent sentences that are
joined by *conjunctive adverbs* (however, therefore, accordingly, finally,
instead, nevertheless, specifically, thus) or *transitional expressions*
(equally important, for example, in fact, on the contrary, on the other hand).
Coordinating conjunctions are strong enough to connect to independent clauses
without extra punctuation (a comma is optional), but conjunctive adverbs and
transitional expressions are not (a colon, semicolon, or period is required).


Relative Clauses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In simple terms, a *relative clause* is a clause that begins with a *relative
pronoun* (which, that, who, whom, whose). Broadly speaking, there are two
types of relative clauses: integral, and supplementary. **The key to using
commas correctly with relative clauses is to consider whether the clause is
providing integral or supplementary information.**

For example:

   CNCP patients, whose complaints of pain are not adequately addressed, start
   to display aberrant drug-related behaviours that are mistaken for
   addiction.

The relative clause is "whose complaints of pain are not adequately
addressed". Surrounding the clause with a pair of commas marks it as
supplementary material, suggesting that *all* CNCP patients have complaints of
pain that are not adequately addressed. If you remove the commas, then the
relative clause is integral material whose function to signify a subgroup of
CNCP patients.


Colons
------

A colon signals that what follows will complement or complete whatever
precedes it: the initial sentence is a promise, the content after the colon
fulfills that promise. Colons provide value in their ability to communicate
that close-knit relationship.

There is only one rule for colons: "**A colon should only appear after
a complete sentence**. A colon indicates that what follows will provide the
information necessary to complete the thought found in the first sentence."


Hyphens and Dashes
------------------

* Hyphen: joins two words into a unit, or indicates a break at the end of
  a line. These are what are present on your keyboard (ie, the "minus" sign).

* Short dash: Often called an 'en-dash' (since it's the width of the letter
  'n'). Separates items such as dates or page numbers (eg, 1711-1776, or pp.
  106-7)

* Long dash: Often called an 'em-dash' (since it's the width of the letter
  'm'). Signals a break in a sentence. Can be appear individually or as pairs.
  A single em-dash is typically an informal replacement for a colon or
  semicolon; a double em-dash is typically a high importance parenthetical.


Interruptions
-------------

Parentheticals, commas, and dashes are a way of "interrupting yourself", in
increasing order of importance.

* **Parentheticals** signal non-essential additions

* **Commas** segment the primary phrase and the supporting phrases, but the
  supporting phrases are still less essential than the primary phrase.

* **Dashes** are like commas, but the content inside the dashes is important.

  They can also be used instead of a comma in a sentence that is already full
  of commas.


Stops
-----

Regarding sentence length: "it generally works well to use short sentences for
emphasis and longer ones for depth."

Regarding direct versus indirect questions: direct questions (sentences ending
with a question mark) tend to be more informal, but may give the impression
that they are still open questions in the authors mind; indirect questions
(those ending with a period) suggest to the reader that the question has been
closed, and the text will provide that answer.

Regarding "rolling stops" (using colons or semicolons): use these sparingly.
A semicolon should be reserved for emphasizing a close connection between
clauses; similarly, a colon is a strong claim that what follows will complete
or complement whatever precedes it. It's easy to abuse punctuation in an
attempt to *impose* flow rather than *establishing* it.


Lists
-----

In a list, there should be a *shared root*, which must work with each list
item.

Lists should:

* Use correct parallelism

* Should be read in the *forward* direction (ie, shared root first)

  Starting with the elements first is a *backward* list. (For example,
  "Squishy apples, smelly oranges, and slimy lettuce are all spoiled foods.")
  The reader doesn't know the shared root until the end, then has to think
  backward to connect all the items; it might not even be obvious that a list
  is occurring until the reader is several items in.

Lists are good for declaring the structure of upcoming content, giving the
reader a sense of sequencing and the relationship between the upcoming
elements.

Sublists should be used with care: if you enter a sublist, add an explicit
announcement when you return to the top-level list, so the reader doesn't get
confused.


Parallelism
-----------

"Sentence elements that are alike in function should also be alike in
construction. These elements should be in the same grammatical form so that
they are parallel." (https://webapps.towson.edu/ows/moduleparallel.htm)

For example:

* *words*: thinking, running

* *infinitives*: to see, to understand

* *prepositional phrases*: at the time, in the house

* *subordinate clauses*: because I care, after they met

Writers typically use parallelism in one of five ways:

1. With elements joined by coordinating conjunctions (esp. {and, but, or})

   * parallel elements: "thinking and running"

   * parallel phrases: "to look but not to listen"

   * parallel clauses: "after coffee or when you're done"

2. Within a list or a series

3. With elements being compared

4. With elements joined by a *linking verb* or a *verb of being*

5. With elements joined by a correlative conjunction

   * either/or, neither/nor, both/and, not only/but also


Scaffolding Phrases
-------------------

In writing, **scaffolding** is an acknowledgement that a document isn't
completed in a single pass. It has to be constructed, and whether that's
a coarse outline, a bland-but-concrete introduction template, or excessively
explicit signposting of content, the author will likely benefit from an
incremental structuring of the document.

A **scaffolding phrase** is one that the author uses while they're writing,
but may eventually be removed. These are often *comfort phrases* that help the
author maintain writing momentum, but would be considered bad form from the
reader's perspective (that is, they do not help the reader).

For example, one of my comfort phrases is "for example", or "ie". Not always
incorrect, but I tend to use it a lot; be careful it's actually helping.

A scaffolding phrase might even be a self-question: "X is important for Y.
*What does that mean?* Y means that..."  You're helping propel yourself
through the train of thought by making the question explicit, but the reader
isn't helped by that explicit question: you display the conclusion.

It's useful to note that *signposting can also benefit the writer*:

* When you make the structure explicit, it's a way of defining and bounding
  your own thoughts, much as you can achieve with good topic sentences.
  Sometimes explicit signposting can fall under that category of scaffolding
  ("useful to the writer, but can be removed later").

* Consider writing **provisional signposting** passages to check your own
  expectations of your text. These can be created before or after the content.


Finding your Voice
------------------
* Replace "voice" with "contribution" to consider your influence on the text

* Don't just regurgitate your findings, *contribute* to the understanding.

* Readers won't like a "writer-less" document; engage with them

Some reasons your voice might not shine through into your writing:

1. **Modesty**: you allow yourself to get shrouded in other peoples ideas, and
   under-emphasize your own contribution. You quote a lot, but contribute
   little.

2. **Inexperience**: You don't understand how to draw attention to your own
   ideas. Practice clarifying the centrality of your own contribution.

3. **Familiarty**: becoming preoccupied with your own material. Our
   contribution becomes more and more familiar to us as we write the document,
   but not to the reader. Don't forget to emphasize the novelty of your
   contributions (ie, help the reader by highlighting what is *new*).
