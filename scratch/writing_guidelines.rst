This is a summary of a set of "Explorations of Style" blog posts on thesis
writing guidelines. Its primary points relate to:

* Fundamental elements

* Writing as thinking

* Extensive revision as a fundamental process

* Helping the reader

Many of the points are not novel, but very well clarified and formalized. This
formalization is helpful for converting an ad-hoc process into a systematic
process. It is invaluable to have a concrete recognition of what works, what
isn't working, and how to approach the revision process.


Fundamental Elements
====================

The author chose five fundamental elements for primary focus:

1. Reverse Outlines: expose the internal structure of a text
2. Paragraphs: "the fundamental unit of discourse" 
3. Transitions: connect sentences, paragraphs, and sections 
4. Verbs: express the actions in your sentences with *strong* verbs 
5. Subjects: use the characters in your sentences as clear subjects


Paragraphs
----------

"A paragraph is the fundamental unit of discourse."

Each paragraph should make a distinct contribution. Put another way,
paragraphs usually need a **topic sentence**. The remaining sentences should
be *thematically linked* to the theme announced in the topic sentence. Length
should be determined by content, not the number of sentences or space required
on the page.

Paragraphs provide the structural basis for the text as a whole. They are the
fundamental units of the **reverse-outline** process for restructuring the
document.


Transitions
-----------

Avoid unclear references. For example "A is connected to B. This is..." versus
"A is connected to B. This *connection* is..." This pattern is `this <summary
word>`, where the summary word makes the "this" reference explicit.

Avoid unnecessary transition words. Problematic transition words tend to be
those that indicate an additional idea: "in addition", "also", "moreover",
etc. While it is possible that the addition may deepen a claim (eg,
"furthermore"), if it only serves to say "here comes another point" it is
probably unnecessary. If you really need a link, remove vague transitions like
"also" and look for a more substantive indication of the link.

Avoid the mere *appearance* of causality. Causal words ("therefore", "thus",
"hence") should be used sparingly, and only in cases of direct causal
relationships.

Use transition words to indicate a change in the direction of your text. If
you've been building up a topic, but then want to take it in a different
direction, make that change in direction obvious: "<buildup>. *However*,
I disagree."

There are also **paragraph transitions** and **transitions between sections**.

 * **sentence transitions**: tend to be `this + summary word`

 * **paragraph transition**:  tend to be `this + summary phrase`

   Careful: words like "however", "in other words" etc, at the start of
   a paragraph, tend to confuse the reader.

 * **section transitions**: can be at the start of a section, the end, or
   wherever an overall structure is created.

   "For example, in a literature review, a writer may say that she is going to
   consider the literature on a certain topic from three perspectives. The
   reader will then be fine with three independent sections without explicit
   transitions between them."

   **Transitions should happen in the text, not in the headings.** As a rule
   of thumb, read through section (and subsection) headings as if they weren't
   there.


Drafting
========

"We write the first draft for ourselves; the drafts thereafter increasingly
for the reader."

Three general aspects of an early draft:

1. Assessment of relevance

   Is it relevant to the topic? To the target audience?

2. Assessment of coherence

   Does the content flow well?

3. Assessment of manageability

   The draft will require revision; can you establish a path to completion?



Introductions
=============

The standard model for structuring introductions uses three "moves":

1. Context
   
   What your audience needs to know in order to understand the problem you are
   going to confront. May act as a refresher, or even a primer, to the topic,
   but will not discuss new material.

2. Problem (and Significance)
   
   What you want to accomplish, and why it will matter to have done so. The
   mere existence of a problem isn't sufficient, you should establish the
   motivation for your upcoming work.

3. Response
   
   What you are actually going to do in your research to address the problem.

Using this structure is effective because **it tells the reader what they need
to know**, not just a wandering story of your own thought process. It is
methodical in setting up the reader's understanding of the text. This explicit
breakdown can also reveal underdeveloped ideas.

If you pay attention to your text, you should see these *moves* throughout
your text. For example, a literature review can be seen as a deeper iteration
of the **context**. Each section of your thesis will likely fall under one of
these categories, and recognizing those categorizations can help guide your
writing.


Thesis Introductions
====================

Because a thesis is such a larger body of work, it can require special
considerations. The reader should not have to wait for a complete and thorough
context before they hear the problem. You may want to start with a big picture
version of the three moves. An **introduction to the introduction**, if you
will. This can be as little as three paragraphs preceding the full context.

For example, your introduction might be structured as follows:

1. Introduction to the introduction
   
   This primes the reader for the context, so they'll be on the lookout for
   the salient points of the problem.

2. Context

3. Restatement of the problem
   
   Your big picture problem description was probably vague, but now that
   you've established a more detailed context you can elaborate on the finer
   points of the problem.

4. Restatement of the response
   
   Same deal as before: leverage the detail presented in the full context to
   elaborate on the details of the response.

5. Roadmap
   
   A brief indication of how the thesis will proceed.

Ideally, a good introduction will serve to make the reader feel comfortable
with the document as soon as possible. It should imbue the reader with a sense
of familiarity, that they know what to expect, thus lowering the cognitive
overhead of trying to make sense of the content.


Revision
========

Revision needs to be both systematic (so you can apply it consistently, and
without having to rethink it all the time) and thorough (so you don't miss
some editorial issues). **A systematic revision strategy gives the writer
confidence that they can fix the issues that inevitably appear.**

Revision is different from proofreading. **Revision** is the active reading
and rearranging of the text; **proofreading** is the process of making
corrections and checking for consistency (while *not* making revision changes
that can introduce new errors!)

Some activities that can be described as revision:

* Word choice: is the vocabulary appropriate?

* sentence structure: are the sentences easy for the reader to follow?

* transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and sections: is the ordering
  optimal, and have you signalled that order to the reader?

* Tone: have you engaged the reader while still conforming to academic writing
  conventions?

* Economy: have you avoided distracting digressions or general wordiness?

* Overall coherence: is there a clear and discernible argument or structure to
  your writing?


Some general tips:

* Try reading the text aloud.

* Read paragraphs out of order: focusing on paragraphs in isolation might
  reveal cohesion issues.

* A text with serious structural issues might work at the local level. This is
  good in the sense that your local work provides a good starting point, but
  can be deceptive if you're myopic in your review. Just because a paragraph
  is *interally* coherent doesn't mean it fits the bigger picture.

* Economy matters: phrases should always be doing important work


Two complimentary methods for checking structural cohesion:

* reverse outline

  Build an outline using numbered topic sentences from each paragraph,
  reorganize the numbers to improve the text structure, then reorganize the
  paragraphs according to their reordered numbers

  Helps you **find structural problems**.

* topic sentence paragraphs

  Copy the topic sentence from each paragraph into a new pseudo-paragraph,
  then try to read it.

  Helps you **confirm structural cohesion**.

Put another way, the *reverse outline* shows what's **wrong**, whereas the
*topic sentence paragraph* confirms what's **right**.


Coarse-to-Fine Issue Ordering
-----------------------------

It is helpful to recognize the different broader issues you will encounter,
and create a **sequence** for dealing with them. For example, the author
suggests this ordering:

1. Broad structural issues

   Start with the big issues. The most effective strategy for structural
   revision is the reverse outline.

   This stage should be ruthless. Some things may have been necessary to be
   *written* (so you can clear up the idea in your head) but not necessary to
   be *read*. Is it useful to the reader? If not, cut it.

   Also important is to remember: **Content that may have been necessary in an
   old draft is no longer serving a purpose in the edited text.** It might be
   good to sequester these sections elsewhere until you can verify if they're
   truly valuable.

2. Clarity
   
   Eliminate unnecessary words and undue complexity * Writers are often
   tempted to distance themselves from their ideas with awkward expressions,
   weak verbs, and unclear subjects.

3. Sentence-level errors

   Subject-verb agreement, ambiguous references (unclear "this", etc), and
   punctuation

4. Cohesion problems

   All the previous changes are likely to introduce new cohesion problems.

   This is a good time to review the **topic sentence paragraphs** to make
   sure the text flows naturally.

This method of focusing on specific issues also encourages time efficient
reviews: **don't try to fix all types of issues at once**. For example, by the
time you're to the proof reading stage you probably don't to keep fiddling
with document structure (which is likely to introduce new errors). **Be strict
about what type of editing you're doing.**


Reverse Outline
---------------

The reverse outline is a strategy for separating structural revision from
content-level revision. You *move the analysis to a higher level of
abstraction so you don't get lost in the details.*

The steps to creating a reverse outline:

1. Number the paragraphs
2. Identify the topic in each paragraph
3. Arrange the topics into an outline
4. Analyze the outline
5. Create a revised outline
6. Reorganize the text according to the revised outline
7. Check for topic sentences and cohesion


1. Number the paragraphs

   Paragraphs are the most basic unit of composition. Numbering them directs
   attention away from sentences, and onto the structure induced by the
   paragraphs.

2. Identify the topic of each paragraph

   This will be challenging in early drafts because many paragraphs will not
   have clear topics.

   *"It is crucial to remember that you are trying to make evident what is
   there rather than what ought to be there."*

   This is a *diagnostic* step: you are **observing** rather than judging or
   remedying.

3. Arrange the topics into an outline

   Change the outline, not the original document. Look past the deeper
   content, focus on the topics, and pretend you're the reader observing the
   *essential structure* of the text.

4. Analyze the outline
   
   "Pay particular attention to the logic and proportionality of the internal
   organization. Understanding the logic involves observing the way elements
   have been placed in relation to one another. Understanding the
   proportionality involves observing how much space is being devoted to each
   element."
   
   This step is the bridge between *noting what you have* and *preparing
   to create something new*.

5. Create a revised outline
   
   You now know more about the text you're writing than when you started. Use
   that new understanding to develop a new **abstract** structure for the
   document.
   
   This higher level of abstraction lets you avoid getting bogged down in the
   details. This is crucial when you're trying to wrap your head around
   a large text.

6. Reorganize the text according to the revised outline

   **This is the first time you actually change the original text!**

   *Move* the content around to match the updated outline. Do not *change* the
   content yet.

   Do not get distracted by the fact that the sections no longer nest as
   intended. This step is not for editing the content, only the ordering.

7. Check for topic sentences and cohesion
   
   **This is the first time you change the content itself!**
   
   Because of the blind reordering, it is likely that the text will have lost
   some cohesion. This is where you resume examining issues such as word
   choice, sentence structure, transitions, tone, economy, and overall
   coherence.


Metadiscourse
=============

*metadiscourse*: "the range of devices writers use to explicitly organize
their texts, engage readers, and signal their attitudes to both their material
and their audience" (Hyland and Tse, 2004)

There should be a three-way relationship between the *text*, the *reader*, and
the *author*. The author should be present in the text: that includes not only
discussing the topic, but also discussing the **text**; help the reader
understand the thinking and structure behind the document.

There are several things you can signal to the reader:

* How the text is organized

* How ideas are related

* How evidence is being used

* How an idea will be re-examined or further explained

* How much strength the author attributes to a particular claim or result

* Personal opinions (eg, "this achievement" vs "this *remarkable*
  achievement", or "this is problematic" vs "this is *particularly*
  problematic")

* The frame of mind the author expects from the reader

  For example, "It is widely recognized that..." signals your stance on the
  matter, so the reader knows how to interpret what is about to follow.

  Another example: "This claim raises an obvious question" signals to the
  reader that you're addressing what you believe to be a glaring issue.

* How the text reflects the authors role:

  * "My use of the term ..."

  * "I will attempt to..."

*Signposting* is an important element of metadiscourse. These help manage
the reader's expectations by signaling how the document is structured. This is
important anywhere structure exists and would be helpful to be made explicit.


Miscellaneous Notes
===================

Colons
------

There is only one rule for colons: "**A colon should only appear after
a complete sentence**. A colon indicates that what follows will provide the
information necessary to complete the thought found in the first sentence."

That initial sentence is a promise, the content after the colon fulfills that
promise. Colons provide value in their ability to communicate that close-knit
relationship.


Lists
-----

In a list, there should be a *shared root*, which must work with each list
item.

Lists should:

 * Use correct parallelism

 * Should be read in the *forward* direction (ie, shared root first)

   Starting with the elements first is a *backward* list. The reader doesn't
   know the shared root until the end, then has to think backward to connect
   all the items.

Lists are good for declaring the structure of upcoming content, giving the
reader a sense of sequencing and the relationship between the upcoming
elements.

Sublists should be used with care: if you enter a sublist, add an explicit
announcement when you return to the top-level list, so the reader doesn't get
confused.


Parallelism
-----------

"Sentence elements that are alike in function should also be alike in
construction. These elements should be in the same grammatical form so that
they are parallel." (https://webapps.towson.edu/ows/moduleparallel.htm)

For example:

 * *words*: thinking, running

 * *infinitives*: to see, to understand

 * *prepositional phrases*: at the time, in the house

 * *subordinate clauses*: because I care, after they met

Writers typically use parallelism in one of five ways:

 1. With elements joined by coordinating conjunctions (esp. {and, but, or})

    * parallel elements: "thinking and running"

    * parallel phrases: "to look but not to listen"

    * parallel clauses: "after coffee or when you're done"

 2. Within a list or a series

 3. With elements being compared

 4. With elements joined by a *linking verb* or a *verb of being*

 5. With elements joined by a correlative conjunction

    * either/or, neither/nor, both/and, not only/but also


Scaffolding Phrases
-------------------

In writing, **scaffolding** is an acknowledgement that a document isn't
completed in a single pass. It has to be constructed, and whether that's
a coarse outline, a bland-but-concrete introduction template, or excessively
explicit signposting of content, the author will likely benefit from an
incremental structuring of the document.

A **scaffolding phrase** is one that the author uses while they're writing,
but may eventually be removed. These are often *comfort phrases* that help the
author maintain writing momentum, but would be considered bad form from the
reader's perspective (that is, they do not help the reader).

For example, one of my comfort phrases is "for example", or "ie". Not always
incorrect, but I tend to use it a lot; be careful it's actually helping.

A scaffolding phrase might even be a self-question: "X is important for Y.
*What does that mean?* Y means that..."  You're helping propel yourself
through the train of thought by making the question explicit, but the reader
isn't helped by that explicit question: you display the conclusion.

It's useful to note that *signposting can also benefit the writer*:

* When you make the structure explicit, it's a way of defining and bounding
  your own thoughts, much as you can achieve with good topic sentences.
  Sometimes explicit signposting can fall under that category of scaffolding
  ("useful to the writer, but can be removed later").

* Consider writing **provisional signposting** passages to check your own
  expectations of your text. These can be created before or after the content.


Dashes
------

Parentheticals, dashes and commas are a way of "interrupting yourself", in
progressing order of importance.

 * **Parentheticals** signal non-essential additions

 * **Commas** segment the primary phrase and the supporting phrases, but the
   supporting phrases are still less essential than the primary phrase.

 * **Dashes** are like commas, but the content inside the dashes is important.

   They can also be used instead of a comma in a sentence that is already full
   of commas.


Finding your Voice
------------------
 * Replace "voice" with "contribution" to consider your influence on the text

 * Don't just regurgitate your findings, *contribute* to the understanding.

 * Readers won't like a "writer-less" document; engage with them

Some reasons your voice might not shine through into your writing:

1. **Modesty**: you allow yourself to get shrouded in other peoples ideas, and
   under-emphasize your own contribution. You quote a lot, but contribute
   little.

2. **Inexperience**: You don't understand how to draw attention to your own
   ideas. Practice clarifying the centrality of your own contribution.

3. **Familiarty**: becoming preoccupied with your own material. Our
   contribution becomes more and more familiar to us as we write the document,
   but not to the reader. Don't forget to emphasize the novelty of your
   contributions (ie, help the reader by highlighting what is *new*).


Commitment to the Reader
------------------------
* Consistent signposting

* Avoid "hedging"

* Exude confidence that the reader can grasp the topic: it is my job to make
  it clear, and yes, the topic can be clearly communicated, whatever it is.

* Avoid "the curse of knowledge": don't lose track of what the *reader* needs
  to know


One-way reading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"readers are entitled to a one-way trip through a piece of writing"

"U-turn signs: vague pronoun reference; unclear use of ordinals; failure to
consistently use core terminology; withholding a verb till the very end of
a sentence; listing without alerting the reader that you are doing so; relying
heavily on devices such as ‘aforementioned’, ‘former/latter’, or
‘respectively’. All of these practices can send readers backwards, denying
them their best chance at a one-way trip through your writing."
