The introduction to the introduction is important to my project since the
scope is so broad. Trying to establish the entire context in detail before
getting to a description of what my thesis offers will make the reader wait
a long time before they learn about my contribution. You need to **put the
contribution of the paper front and center; the reader should know ASAP what
they will gain by reading it.**

John Swales' model for "Creating a Research Space" consists of three "moves":

1. Establishing a research territory
 
2. Establishing a niche
 
3. Occupying the niche

 
(An alternative is "Context", "Problem and Significance", and "Response".)

According to Explorations of Style, "An Introduction to the introduction [...]
will be a short version of the three moves, often in as little as three
paragraphs, ending with some sort of transition to the next section where the
full context will be provided."

In my case, I will first set the context (my research territory: paragliding
dependencies on wind patterns), then introduce my motivating goal (my niche:
learning wind patterns from flight data), then introduce how I've made
progress towards goal (how I've occupied the niche: by building the flight
reconstruction portion of the model).
