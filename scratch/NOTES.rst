Trouble Words
=============

* "paraglider wing" vs "paragliding wing"

* accelerator, speedbar/speed-bar/speed bar

* timestep, time-step, time step

* vario, variometer (allowable abbreviations)


Useful Reminders
================

* Use ReST comments to document structural peculiarities (eg, in my HTML
  versus LaTeX sources)

* Signposting is a useful way for the writer to layout their work. It's a way
  of telling yourself what you're going to work on next. Also, you can look
  back and see how your expected path has diverged.

* Just signposting *what* you're going to do isn't as helpful as first
  communicating *why* the *what* is necessary.

  Consider "I will discuss particle filtering." versus "Recreating the flight
  requires filling in missing pieces; this type of artificial data generation
  is known as simulation-based filtering. One such method is the particle
  filter."
