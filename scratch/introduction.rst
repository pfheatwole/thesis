Introduction to a thesis
------------------------

The structure of an introduction to a thesis, as presented by "Explorations of
Style":

1. Introduction to the introduction

   This section is a condensed version of the three moves (context, problem,
   and response). For a thesis, this may be useful for "getting to the point"
   more quickly than a full introduction, but without the extreme concision of
   an abstract.

2. Context

   "Provides the full context in a way that flows from the opening."

3. Restatement of the problem

   "Restate the problem and significance in light of the more thoroughly
   detailed context."

4. Restatement of the response

   Now that I've highlighted the set of problems, discuss my work towards
   solving those problems. This time, leverage the detail in the *full*
   context and restated problem description to elaborate on the details of the
   response.

5. Roadmap



Intro to the Intro
------------------

The introduction to the introduction is important to my project since the
scope is so broad. Trying to establish the entire context in detail before
getting to a description of what my thesis offers will make the reader wait
a long time before they learn about my contribution. You need to **put the
contribution of the paper front and center; the reader should know ASAP what
they will gain by reading it.**

John Swales' model for "Creating a Research Space" consists of three "moves":

1. Establishing a research territory
 
2. Establishing a niche
 
3. Occupying the niche

 
(An alternative is "Context", "Problem and Significance", and "Response".)

According to Explorations of Style, "An Introduction to the introduction [...]
will be a short version of the three moves, often in as little as three
paragraphs, ending with some sort of transition to the next section where the
full context will be provided."

In my case, I will first set the context (my research territory: paragliding
dependencies on wind patterns), then introduce my motivating goal (my niche:
learning wind patterns from flight data), then introduce how I've made
progress towards goal (how I've occupied the niche: by building the flight
reconstruction portion of the model).
