* What is *dynamic simulation*?

  From Wikipedia: "*Dynamic simulation* (or dynamic system simulation) is the
  use of a computer program to model the time-varying behavior of a dynamical
  system. The systems are typically described by ordinary differential
  equations or partial differential equations. A simulation run solves the
  state-equation system to find the behavior of the state variables over
  a specified period of time. The equation is solved through numerical
  integration methods to produce the transient behavior of the state
  variables. Simulation of dynamic systems predicts the values of model-system
  state variables, as they are determined the past state values. This
  relationship is found by creating a model of the system."
