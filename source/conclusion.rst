.. What are the results of this project?

[[Assume an impatient reader will jump here. This is your last chance to
convince them the paper is worth reading.]]

* A parametric geometry and a dynamics model in Python. Includes several state
  models and simulator.

* Derivations available in appendices.

* Code available on Github using open source libraries

  * Why Python?

    * Approachable syntax

    * Good cross-domain language

    * Free (unlike matlab)

    * Numerical libraries (numpy, scipy)

    * Large library ecosystem (s2sphere, sklearn, databases, PyMC3, pandas, etc)

    * Easy integration into tools w/ native support (Blender, FreeCAD, QGIS)

      * Generate a simulation directly inside Blender

      * Design a wing and estimate it's polar curve inside FreeCAD

* Developed entirely using freely available tools (XFLR5, AVL, etc) and open
  source libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc)

* The entire work is under permissive licensing: code is MIT, text and figures
  are CC-BY
