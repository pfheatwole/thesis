Is it possible to recover local wind vectors from position-only paragliding
flight data? Developing that question is the purpose of this project. The
ability to recreate the wind conditions from individual flights would enable
the possibility of learning wind patterns from databases of recorded flights.

[[I was using terminology like "feasibility", but I never did really establish
feasibility, did I?]]

[[Elaborate: the purpose alone isn't good enough. **What were the outcomes?**
For example, the stages of the proposed processing pipeline; the paraglider
model; statistical learning methods for the model; simulated-based filtering
for the wind. How am I making clear advances towards immediate success, or
towards preparing future research for success?]]
