It is trivial to produce an accurate estimate of the wind conditions that were
present during a paragliding flight: simply answering "somewhere between 0 and
5000 km/h" would suffice. However, although that answer is technically
correct, it is so imprecise that it is useless. The difficult task is to
improve the precision while maintaining the accuracy. If the flight is
in-progress then the estimate can be updated as the paraglider moves and
rotates in response to the wind, but what if the flight has finished and all
that remains is a record of its position over time? Is it possible to recover
usefully precise estimates of the wind from position-only flight data?
Developing that question is the motivation for this project. The ability to
recreate the wind conditions from individual flights would enable the
possibility of learning wind patterns from databases of recorded flights.

[[Originally I was using phrases like "demonstrate feasibility", but I never
did that. **Maybe I can use flight test cases to demonstrate different flight
scenarios that produce the same GPS track? Not the same as demonstrating
success, but might at least demonstrate feasibility.**]]

[[Elaborate: the purpose alone isn't good enough. **What were the outcomes?**
For example, the stages of the proposed processing pipeline; the paraglider
model; statistical learning methods for the model; simulated-based filtering
for the wind. How am I making clear advances towards immediate success, or
towards preparing future research for success?]]
