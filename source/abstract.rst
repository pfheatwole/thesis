It is trivial to produce an accurate estimate of the wind conditions that were
present during a paragliding flight: simply answering "somewhere between 0 and
5000 km/h" would suffice. However, although the answer is technically correct,
it is so imprecise as to be useless. The difficulty is to improve the
precision while maintaining the accuracy. If the flight is ongoing the
estimate can be updated as the paraglider rises and falls and twists and turns
in response to the wind, but what if the flight has finished and all that
remains is a record of its position over time? Is it possible to recover
usefully precise estimates of the wind from position-only flight data?
Developing that question is the motivation for this project. The ability to
recreate the wind conditions from individual flights would enable the
possibility of learning wind patterns from databases of recorded flights.

[[I was using terminology like "feasibility", but I never did really establish
feasibility, did I? **Maybe I can use flight test cases to demonstrate
different flight scenarios that produce the same GPS track? Not the same as
demonstrating success, but might at least demonstrate feasibility.**]]

[[Elaborate: the purpose alone isn't good enough. **What were the outcomes?**
For example, the stages of the proposed processing pipeline; the paraglider
model; statistical learning methods for the model; simulated-based filtering
for the wind. How am I making clear advances towards immediate success, or
towards preparing future research for success?]]
