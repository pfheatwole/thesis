This is in contrast to other known approaches which typically sacrifice optimality to attain space efficiency. The main idea behind our approach is to dynamically exploit the existence of similarity and/or correlation between the time series. The more the similarity between the time series the less space required to compute the DTW between them. To the best of our knowledge, all other techniques to speedup DTW, impose apriori constraints and do not exploit similarity characteristics that may be present in the data. We conduct experiments and demonstrate that SparseDTW outperforms previous approaches.},

  abstract = {An analysis of paraglider performance has revealed that wing section drag is the most significant contribution to overall drag. Wind tunnel measurements performed on two-dimensional hollow models indicate that intake drag is less significant than previously thought. An experimental investigation into the characteristics of a `quasi ' -two-dimensional flexible model consisting of solid ribs covered with a fabric skin was performed at realistic Reynolds numbers. The main cause of performance deterioration was found to be a significant reduction in section lift coefficient when compared to a similar solid wing section. This is believed to be mainly due to two factors: a large trailing edge separation and the deformation of the wing between ribs. The deformation was measured and it was shown that the deformed shape is less capable of generating high lift coefficients than the design section. It is thought that the extent of the trailing edge separation is increased due to the presence of streamwise grooves caused by the shape deformation of the wing. The shape of the separated region was found to be strongly three-dimensional with the separation point being about half a chord-length further upstream along the ribs. A small separation bubble was also observed immediately behind the lip of the intake, due to the fabric `flaring' open. Based on the observations presented a number of suggestions for improved wings have been made.},

  abstract = {A flight-path reconstruction algorithm for tethered aircraft, which is based on an extended Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm is fed by the measurements of a set of onboard and ground-based instruments and provides the optimal estimation of the system state-space trajectory, which includes typical aircraft variables such as position and velocity, as well as an estimation of the aerodynamic force and torque. Therefore, it can be applied to closed-loop control in airborne wind energy systems and it is a first step toward aerodynamic parameter identification of tethered aircraft using flight-test data. The performance of the algorithm is investigated by feeding it with real flight data obtained from a low-cost and highly portable experimental setup with a four-line kite. Several flight tests, which include pullup and lateral-directional steering maneuvers with two kites of different areas, are conducted. The coherence of the estimations provided by the filter, such as the kite state-space trajectory and aerodynamic forces and torques, is analyzed. For some standard variables, such as kite Euler angles and position, the results are also compared with a second independent onboard estimator.},

  doi = {10.13140/RG.2.2.26221.82409},
  abstract = {In this work, an extension to the classic Prandtl's Lifting Line theory is presented. It incorporates two major differences from the original method: (i) a non-linearization of the induced Angle of Attack and (ii) the incorporation of viscosity and compressibility through the use of 2-D aerodynamic data from numerical panel method XFOIL. The final purpose is to have a fast and reliable preliminary aerodynamic tool for wing design. Several cases were tested to assess the validity of the tool. Convergence studies for elliptical wing under potential and real flows were done and validation analysis performed by comparison with experimental data and from widely known literature and numerical methods, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, through the use of commercial software Star-CCM+. It was found that the new method is a much faster tool in comparison to Star-CCM+ and that comparison of the lift coefficient to both Star-CCM+ and experimental data are in good agreement for low values of the angle of attack. However, as the angle increases, these values start to diverge from each other. The angle of attack at which stall occurs is also overestimated (by about 2 degrees) from the experiment. For the drag coefficient, values agree well for the straight wing, while they are not as good for the case of the elliptical wing, whose values start becoming in good agreement at high values of the angle of attack. Finally, a sweptback wing is evaluated. Convergence results show that the original formulation proposed is not suitable and two adaptations were proposed, and placing the control points half chord away from the bound vortices seemed to solve the issue, although a different boundary condition must be imposed for this case. The sweptback wing is validated against experimental data and no close results were obtained, as expected since none of the approaches were completely suitable. The Adapted Prandtl Non-Linear Lifting Line Theory has the potential to be a powerful preliminary wing design tool, given that necessary corrections to the method be made.},

An inviscid linear-vorticity panel method with a Karman-Tsien compressiblity correction is developed for direct and mixed-inverse modes. Source distributions superimposed on the airfoil and wake permit modeling of viscous layer influence on the potential flow. A two-equation lagged dissipation integral method is used to represent the viscous layers. Both laminar and turbulent layers are treated, with an e9-type amplification formulation determinining the transition point. The boundary layer and transition equations are solved simultaneously with the inviscid flowfield by a global Newton method. The procedure is especially suitable for rapid analysis of low Reynolds number airfoil flows with transitional separation bubbles. Surface pressure distributions and entire polars are calculated and compared with experimental data. Design procedure examples are also presented.},

  abstract = {The induced lift is defined as the lift due to the velocities that the lifting vortices induce on themselves. This lift does not increase the induced drag. This has the same effect as decreasing the induced drag without changing the lift. A simple method is given for the evaluation of the induced lift. The rollup of the wake is not considered. It probably has less effect than the induced lift, at least for the high aspect ratios of gliders. The results from several parameter variations are presented. They concern dihedral and winglets as well as sweep back.},

  abstract = {State-space models can be used to incorporate subject knowledge on the underlying dynamics of a time series by the introduction of a latent Markov state-process. A user can specify the dynamics of this process together with how the state relates to partial and noisy observations that have been made. Inference and prediction then involves solving a challenging inverse problem: calculating the conditional distribution of quantities of interest given the observations. This article reviews Monte Carlo algorithms for solving this inverse problem, covering methods based on the particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter. We discuss the challenges posed by models with high-dimensional states, joint estimation of parameters and the state, and inference for the history of the state process. We also point out some potential new developments which will be important for tackling cutting-edge filtering applications.},

  abstract = {Purpose Aerodynamics of paragliders is very complicated aeroelastic phenomena. The purpose of this work is to quantify the amount of aerodynamic drag related to the flexible nature of a paraglider wing. Design/methodology/approach The laboratory testing on scaled models can be very difficult because of problems in the elastic similitude of such a structure. Testing of full-scale models in a large facility with a large full-scale test section is very expensive. The degradation of aerodynamic characteristics is evaluated from flight tests of the paraglider speed polar. All aspects of the identification such as pilot and suspension lines drag and aerodynamics of spanwise chambered wings are discussed. The drag of a pilot in a harness was estimated by means of wind tunnel testing, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver was used to estimating smooth wing lift and drag characteristics. Findings The drag related to the flexible nature of the modern paraglider wing is within the range of 4-30 per cent of the total aerodynamic drag depending on the flight speed. From the results, it is evident that considering only the cell opening effect is sufficient at a low-speed flight. The stagnation point moves forwards towards the nose during the high speed flight. This causes more pronounced deformation of the leading edge and thus increased drag. Practical implications This paper deals with a detailed analysis of specific paraglider wing. Although the results are limited to the specific geometry, the findings help in the better understanding of the paraglider aerodynamics generally. Originality/value The data obtained in this paper are not affected by any scaling problems. There are only few experimental results in the field of paragliders on scaled models. Those results were made on simplified models at very low Reynolds number. The aerodynamic drag characteristics of the pilot in the harness with variable angles of incidence and Reynolds numbers have not yet been published.},

Despite strong bias due to under-resolved boundary layers, numerical results of the cloth deformations are in an acceptable agreement with wind tunnel measurements conducted in a previous study on a small and simple parachute geometry.},

The writing starts with making figures and tables. These suggest several terse summary statements, the few major conclusions or observations the author will present to the scientific community. After identification of the audience, the specific community addressed, materials and methods are written to explain how the tables and figures were generated. Results are initially restricted to describing the logical data relations in each table and figure. The discussion then converts each data relationship into mechanistic cause-and-effect interpretations suitable for the abstract. A brief epilogue deals with the submission and the fate of the final manuscript once submitted. Although other models for the initial draft exist, this model has worked for us and new researchers in our laboratories and addresses problems we encountered while editing manuscripts.},

Instead of focusing on particular application areas, the authors adopt a general dynamical systems approach, with a profusion of low-dimensional, discrete-time numerical examples designed to build intuition about the subject. Part I explains the mathematical framework of ensemble-based probabilistic forecasting and uncertainty quantification. Part II is devoted to Bayesian filtering algorithms, from classical data assimilation algorithms such as the Kalman filter, variational techniques, and sequential Monte Carlo methods, through to more recent developments such as the ensemble Kalman filter and ensemble transform filters. The McKean approach to sequential filtering in combination with coupling of measures serves as a unifying mathematical framework throughout Part II. Assuming only some basic familiarity with probability, this book is an ideal introduction for graduate students in applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, geoscience and other emerging application areas.},

  abstract = {Implementations of lifting-line theory model the flow over a finite wing using a sheet of semi-infinite vortices extending from a vortex filament placed along the locus of aerodynamic centers of the wing. Prandtl's classical implementation is restricted to straight wings in flows without sideslip. In this work, it is shown that these limitations can be overcome if, at the control points where induced velocity is calculated, the second derivative of the locus of aerodynamic centers is zero and the trailing vortices are perpendicular to the locus. Therefore, a general implementation of lifting-line theory is presented that conditionally forces the second derivative of the locus of aerodynamic centers to zero at each control point, and joints each trailing vortex such that there is a finite segment of the trailing vortex perpendicular to the locus of aerodynamic centers. Consideration is given to modeling the locus of aerodynamic centers of non-straight wings and the section aerodynamic properties of such wings. The resulting general formulation is analyzed to determine sensitivity, accuracy, and numerical convergence. The general implementation demonstrates second-order convergence when the control points are clustered at the root and tips of the wing, and produces results that closely match those of a higher-order panel method and experimental data.},
