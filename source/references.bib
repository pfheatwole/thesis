  abstract = {An analysis of paraglider performance has revealed that wing section drag is the most significant contribution to overall drag. Wind tunnel measurements performed on two-dimensional hollow models indicate that intake drag is less significant than previously thought. An experimental investigation into the characteristics of a `quasi ' -two-dimensional flexible model consisting of solid ribs covered with a fabric skin was performed at realistic Reynolds numbers. The main cause of performance deterioration was found to be a significant reduction in section lift coefficient when compared to a similar solid wing section. This is believed to be mainly due to two factors: a large trailing edge separation and the deformation of the wing between ribs. The deformation was measured and it was shown that the deformed shape is less capable of generating high lift coefficients than the design section. It is thought that the extent of the trailing edge separation is increased due to the presence of streamwise grooves caused by the shape deformation of the wing. The shape of the separated region was found to be strongly three-dimensional with the separation point being about half a chord-length further upstream along the ribs. A small separation bubble was also observed immediately behind the lip of the intake, due to the fabric `flaring' open. Based on the observations presented a number of suggestions for improved wings have been made.},

  doi = {10.13140/RG.2.2.26221.82409},
  abstract = {In this work, an extension to the classic Prandtl's Lifting Line theory is presented. It incorporates two major differences from the original method: (i) a non-linearization of the induced Angle of Attack and (ii) the incorporation of viscosity and compressibility through the use of 2-D aerodynamic data from numerical panel method XFOIL. The final purpose is to have a fast and reliable preliminary aerodynamic tool for wing design. Several cases were tested to assess the validity of the tool. Convergence studies for elliptical wing under potential and real flows were done and validation analysis performed by comparison with experimental data and from widely known literature and numerical methods, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, through the use of commercial software Star-CCM+. It was found that the new method is a much faster tool in comparison to Star-CCM+ and that comparison of the lift coefficient to both Star-CCM+ and experimental data are in good agreement for low values of the angle of attack. However, as the angle increases, these values start to diverge from each other. The angle of attack at which stall occurs is also overestimated (by about 2 degrees) from the experiment. For the drag coefficient, values agree well for the straight wing, while they are not as good for the case of the elliptical wing, whose values start becoming in good agreement at high values of the angle of attack. Finally, a sweptback wing is evaluated. Convergence results show that the original formulation proposed is not suitable and two adaptations were proposed, and placing the control points half chord away from the bound vortices seemed to solve the issue, although a different boundary condition must be imposed for this case. The sweptback wing is validated against experimental data and no close results were obtained, as expected since none of the approaches were completely suitable. The Adapted Prandtl Non-Linear Lifting Line Theory has the potential to be a powerful preliminary wing design tool, given that necessary corrections to the method be made.},

A two-equation lagged dissipation integral method is used to represent the viscous layers. Both laminar and turbulent layers are treated, with an e9-type amplification formulation determinining the transition point. The boundary layer and transition equations are solved simultaneously with the inviscid flowfield by a global Newton method. The procedure is especially suitable for rapid analysis of low Reynolds number airfoil flows with transitional separation bubbles. Surface pressure distributions and entire polars are calculated and compared with experimental data. Design procedure examples are also presented.},

  abstract = {Purpose Aerodynamics of paragliders is very complicated aeroelastic phenomena. The purpose of this work is to quantify the amount of aerodynamic drag related to the flexible nature of a paraglider wing. Design/methodology/approach The laboratory testing on scaled models can be very difficult because of problems in the elastic similitude of such a structure. Testing of full-scale models in a large facility with a large full-scale test section is very expensive. The degradation of aerodynamic characteristics is evaluated from flight tests of the paraglider speed polar. All aspects of the identification such as pilot and suspension lines drag and aerodynamics of spanwise chambered wings are discussed. The drag of a pilot in a harness was estimated by means of wind tunnel testing, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver was used to estimating smooth wing lift and drag characteristics. Findings The drag related to the flexible nature of the modern paraglider wing is within the range of 4-30 per cent of the total aerodynamic drag depending on the flight speed. From the results, it is evident that considering only the cell opening effect is sufficient at a low-speed flight. The stagnation point moves forwards towards the nose during the high speed flight. This causes more pronounced deformation of the leading edge and thus increased drag. Practical implications This paper deals with a detailed analysis of specific paraglider wing. Although the results are limited to the specific geometry, the findings help in the better understanding of the paraglider aerodynamics generally. Originality/value The data obtained in this paper are not affected by any scaling problems. There are only few experimental results in the field of paragliders on scaled models. Those results were made on simplified models at very low Reynolds number. The aerodynamic drag characteristics of the pilot in the harness with variable angles of incidence and Reynolds numbers have not yet been published.},

  abstract = {Implementations of lifting-line theory model the flow over a finite wing using a sheet of semi-infinite vortices extending from a vortex filament placed along the locus of aerodynamic centers of the wing. Prandtl's classical implementation is restricted to straight wings in flows without sideslip. In this work, it is shown that these limitations can be overcome if, at the control points where induced velocity is calculated, the second derivative of the locus of aerodynamic centers is zero and the trailing vortices are perpendicular to the locus. Therefore, a general implementation of lifting-line theory is presented that conditionally forces the second derivative of the locus of aerodynamic centers to zero at each control point, and joints each trailing vortex such that there is a finite segment of the trailing vortex perpendicular to the locus of aerodynamic centers. Consideration is given to modeling the locus of aerodynamic centers of non-straight wings and the section aerodynamic properties of such wings. The resulting general formulation is analyzed to determine sensitivity, accuracy, and numerical convergence. The general implementation demonstrates second-order convergence when the control points are clustered at the root and tips of the wing, and produces results that closely match those of a higher-order panel method and experimental data.},
