This is a rough draft implementation of the reference wing using `MachUpX`
from the Utah State University. I was only interested in the `CL` to sanity
check my implementation of the NLLT, so the airfoil coefficients are
linearized and I didn't bother checking the pitching coefficients.

Requires:

* `airfoil_db`: https://github.com/usuaero/AirfoilDatabase

* `MachUpX`: https://github.com/usuaero/MachUpX/

To run: `python -m machupX tunneltest.json`
