Builds a set of inputs for AVL's command line interface to save the hassle of
generating all the alpha/beta combinations.

Run `rebuild.sh` to generate the keystroke inputs that configure, run, and save
each test case, then convert the run outputs into polar sequences, organized by
`beta`.

Each alpha/beta combination generates a solution in AVL, which is converted
into polars organized by `beta`. Moments are in body axes instead of stability
axes since that simplifies comparing them to the wind tunnel data.
