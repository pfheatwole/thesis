* Scenario: indirect hit of strong thermal

  Do you get sucked into or pushed out of a thermal? Sort of both. With
  notable **roll-yaw coupling** touching a thermal on the right will make you
  roll right, pitch forward, but yaw left. If you're focused on the roll and
  pitch, you're "sucked in", but if you're focused on yaw you're "pushed out".


* Scenario: roll-steering vs skid-steering

  Build two versions of the Hook3 with small and large radii arcs. The
  small-radius arc demonstrates skid-steering (typical paraglider behavior),
  the flattened arc demonstrates roll-steering (typical sailplane behavior).
  Essentially, as the radius increases the brakes transition into flaps.

  See `slegers2003AspectsControlParafoil`. I think the X-38 papers also
  experience this?
