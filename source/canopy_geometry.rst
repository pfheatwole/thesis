Canopy Geometry

The essential component of gliding flight is the lifting surface. For
a paraglider, lift is generated by an inflatable nylon parafoil, which uses
energy gained from gravity to generate useful aerodynamic forces by exchanging
momentum with the air.

Airfoil
=======

**Key terms and concepts to define in this section**: upper surface, lower
surface, leading edge, trailing edge, chord line, mean camber line, thickness,
thickness convention, 2D coefficients.


Geometry
--------

An airfoil is a 2D cross-section of a 3D wing.

.. figure:: figures/paraglider/geometry/airfoil/airfoil_examples.*

   Airfoils examples.

Here's a diagram of the basic airfoil geometric properties:

   Airfoil geometry.


There are two conventions measuring the airfoil thickness; this convention
also determines what point is designated the *leading edge*. The leading and
trailing edge of a wing section are arbitrary points that define the *chord*;
the chord is used to nondimensionalize the airfoil geometry and define the
*angle of attack*.

Chord Surface
=============

The chord surface is a conceptual curved surface produced by all the airfoil
chord lines. A wing geometry can be defined by a *chord surface* and an
*airfoil distribution*.

.. TODO:: define the *section index*

The surface can be defined using six curves as functions of the section index:

1. Chord length :math:`c(s)`

#. Geometric torsion :math:`\theta(s)`

#. Chord reference point for the xy-plane :math:`r_{xy}(s)`

#. Chord reference point for the yz-plane :math:`r_{yz}(s)`

#. Position of the reference point in the xy-plane :math:`x(s)`

#. Position of the reference point in the yz-plane :math:`\left< y(s),
   z(s)\right>`

These six functions define the scale, orientation, and position of each foil
section. Section scale is controlled by chord; each section profile is an
airfoil scaled by the chord length. Section orientation is controlled by
section 

.. TODO:: I should explicitly mention that with this set of definitions,
   section profiles will always "point" towards the +x-axis (mathematically,
   this means the plane containing each section will also contain the
   +x-axis). I'm pretty sure this is a reasonable constraint for most wing
   designs?

The chord length is the scaling factor. Geometric torsion rotates
section profile chords relative to their immediate neighboring sections.
Positions


What are the advantages of this parametric design?

* It's easy to query arbitrary points on the chord surface and foil surface,
  making it easy to integrate with existing aerodynamic methods (eg,
  Phillips).

* You can use (mostly) arbitrary functions for the curves, like linear
  interpolators or Bezier curves. This makes it easy to design custom curve
  shapes, and it makes it easy to recreate a geometry that was specified in
  points (like in Belloc). You can use Bezier curves if you want.

* It decouples design in the xy and yz planes, so as you design a shape
  towards a target, adjust one parameter doesn't break the previous work (eg,
  if you set the quarter-chord the way you want it you don't have to worry
  about changes to geometric torsion messing that up).

* As a generative model, it's easy to integrate into a CAD or 3D modeling
  program

Geometric Torsion
-----------------

(One of the cool things about my geometry is that you don't need to specify
the rotation point. The airfoil angle is independent of the rotation point, so
it's unnecessary work to require a user to calculate positions relative to
rotation points.)

Foil Surface
============

The chord surface is the flat surface produced by all the section chord. To
produce the 3D canopy, each section must be assigned an airfoil.


Examples
========

**FIXME**: doesn't this be belong to the "chord surface" section?


Flat Wings
----------

Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

First, design the set of reference curves to generate the target chord
surface:

.. figure:: figures/paraglider/geometry/canopy/examples/build/flat1_curves.*

Then assign an airfoil to produce the 3D wing:

(**FIXME: maybe show the chord surface just this first time?**)

.. figure:: figures/paraglider/geometry/canopy/examples/build/flat1_canopy.*

This is an idealized version of the target canopy because it has not accounted
for cell deformations, such as billowing.


Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

Elliptical Wings

Here's an example with a root-to-tip anhedral angle of 33 degrees.

anhedral angle of 89 degrees.

Distortions
===========

**FIXME**: should I discuss cells, billowing, distortion, etc? I'm not working
on / implementing these, so they can probably go in the "Limitations" section
(whatever that turns out to be)

References:

* Babinksy (:cite:`babinsky1999AerodynamicPerformanceParagliders`) discusses
  the effect of billowing on flow separation, and
  :cite:`babinsky1999AerodynamicImprovementsParaglider` discusses using
  stiffeners to reduce the impact

* Kulhanek (:cite:`kulhanek2019IdentificationDegradationAerodynamic`) has
  brief discussion of these impacts

* Belloc (:cite:`belloc2016InfluenceAirInlet`) discusses the effects of air
  intakes, and suggests some modeling choices

* Altmann (:cite:`altmann2009NumericalSimulationParafoil`) discusses the
  overall impact of cell billowing on glide performance, and has a great
  discussion of how design choices (cell structure, ribs, etc) can mitigate
  the problem; in future papers
  (:cite:`altmann2015FluidStructureInteractionAnalysis`,
  :cite:`altmann2019FluidStructureInteractionAnalysis`) he discusses
  implementation details. Fogell
  (:cite:`fogell2014FluidstructureInteractionSimulations`,
  :cite:`fogell2017FluidStructureInteractionSimulation`,
  :cite:`fogell2017FluidStructureInteractionSimulations`) has a lot to say
  on FSI, including some critique of the applicability of Altmann's method
  to parachutes.

  Another recent paper well worth reviewing (good discussions and great
  references list) is :cite:`lolies2019NumericalMethodsEfficient`, which is
  co-authored by Bruce Goldsmith! Neat. One of their big ideas seems to be
  using "mass-spring systems" from computer animation applications for
  paraglider cloth simulations.
