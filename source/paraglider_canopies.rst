Paraglider Canopies
*******************

The essential component of gliding flight is the lifting surface. For
a paraglider, lift is generated by an inflatable nylon parafoil, which uses
energy gained from gravity to generate useful aerodynamic forces by exchanging
momentum with the air.


Airfoil
=======

An airfoil is the 2D profile of a cross-section of a 3D wing.

Chord Surface
=============

The chord surface is a conceptual curved surface produced by all the airfoil
chord lines. A wing geometry can be defined by a chord surface and an airfoil
distribution.

The surface can be defined using six curves as functions of the section index:

1. Chord length

2. Chord reference point for the xy-plane

3. Chord reference point for the yz-plane

4. Position of the reference point in the xy-plane

5. Position of the reference point in the yz-plane

6. Geometric torsion

Examples

Example 1
---------

First, define a set of reference curves:

.. list-table:: Chord surface reference curves
   :name: chord_surface_curves_example1
   :header-rows: 0
   :align: center

   * - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_c.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_rxy.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_ryz.*
   * - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_x.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_yz.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_theta.*


Then, assign an airfoil across the chord surface to produce an idealized
canopy:

.. figure:: figures/paraglider/example1/canopy1.*
