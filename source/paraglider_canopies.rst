Paraglider Canopies
*******************

The essential component of gliding flight is the lifting surface. For
a paraglider, lift is generated by an inflatable nylon parafoil, which uses
energy gained from gravity to generate useful aerodynamic forces by exchanging
momentum with the air.

surface, leading edge, trailing edge, chord line, mean camber line, thickness,
thickness convention, 2D coefficients.


Geometry
--------

An airfoil is the 2D profile of a cross-section of a 3D wing.

Here's a diagram of the basic airfoil geometric properties:

There are two conventions measuring the airfoil thickness; this convention
also determines what point is designated the *leading edge*.

Chord Surface
=============

The chord surface is a conceptual curved surface produced by all the airfoil
chord lines. A wing geometry can be defined by a chord surface and an airfoil
distribution.

The surface can be defined using six curves as functions of the section index:

1. Chord length

2. Chord reference point for the xy-plane

3. Chord reference point for the yz-plane

4. Position of the reference point in the xy-plane

5. Position of the reference point in the yz-plane

6. Geometric torsion

Example 1
---------

First, define a set of reference curves:

.. list-table:: Chord surface reference curves
   :name: chord_surface_curves_example1
   :header-rows: 0
   :align: center

   * - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_c.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_rxy.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_ryz.*
   * - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_x.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_yz.*
     - .. image:: figures/paraglider/example1/chord_surface_theta.*


Then, assign an airfoil across the chord surface to produce an idealized
canopy:

   :width: 75%
