Paraglider Canopies
*******************

The essential component of gliding flight is the lifting surface. For
a paraglider, lift is generated by an inflatable nylon parafoil, which uses
energy gained from gravity to generate useful aerodynamic forces by exchanging
momentum with the air.

Airfoil
=======

**Key terms and concepts to define in this section**: upper surface, lower
surface, leading edge, trailing edge, chord line, mean camber line, thickness,
thickness convention, 2D coefficients.


Geometry
--------

An airfoil is a 2D cross-section of a 3D wing.

   Airfoils examples.

Here's a diagram of the basic airfoil geometric properties:

   Airfoil geometry.


There are two conventions measuring the airfoil thickness; this convention
also determines what point is designated the *leading edge*. The leading and
trailing edge of a wing section are arbitrary points that define the *chord*;
the chord is used to nondimensionalize the airfoil geometry and define the
*angle of attack*.

Chord Surface
=============

The chord surface is a conceptual curved surface produced by all the airfoil
chord lines. A wing geometry can be defined by a *chord surface* and an
*airfoil distribution*.

.. TODO:: define the *section index*

The surface can be defined using six curves as functions of the section index:

1. Chord length :math:`c(s)`

#. Geometric torsion :math:`\theta(s)`

#. Chord reference point for the xy-plane :math:`r_{xy}(s)`

#. Chord reference point for the yz-plane :math:`r_{yz}(s)`

#. Position of the reference point in the xy-plane :math:`x(s)`

#. Position of the reference point in the yz-plane :math:`\left< y(s),
   z(s)\right>`

These six functions define the scale, orientation, and position of each foil
section. Section scale is controlled by chord; each section profile is an
airfoil scaled by the chord length. Section orientation is controlled by
section 

.. TODO:: I should explicitly mention that with this set of definitions,
   section profiles will always "point" towards the +x-axis (mathematically,
   this means the plane containing each section will also contain the
   +x-axis). I'm pretty sure this is a reasonable constraint for most wing
   designs?

The chord length is the scaling factor. Geometric torsion rotates
section profile chords relative to their immediate neighboring sections.
Positions


What are the advantages of this parametric design?

* It's easy to query arbitrary points on the chord surface and foil surface,
  making it easy to integrate with existing aerodynamic methods (eg,
  Phillips).

* You can use (mostly) arbitrary functions for the curves, like linear
  interpolators or Bezier curves. This makes it easy to design custom curve
  shapes, and it makes it easy to recreate a geometry that was specified in
  points (like in Belloc). You can use Bezier curves if you want.

* It decouples design in the xy and yz planes, so as you design a shape
  towards a target, adjust one parameter doesn't break the previous work (eg,
  if you set the quarter-chord the way you want it you don't have to worry
  about changes to geometric torsion messing that up).

* As a generative model, it's easy to integrate into a CAD or 3D modeling
  program

Geometric Torsion
-----------------

(One of the cool things about my geometry is that you don't need to specify
the rotation point. The airfoil angle is independent of the rotation point, so
it's unnecessary work to require a user to calculate positions relative to
rotation points.)

Examples
========

**FIXME**: doesn't this be belong to the "chord surface" section?


Flat Wings
----------

Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

First, design the set of reference curves to generate the target chord
surface:

.. figure:: figures/paraglider/geometry/canopy/examples/build/flat1_curves.*

Then assign an airfoil to produce the 3D wing:

(**FIXME: maybe show the chord surface just this first time?**)

.. figure:: figures/paraglider/geometry/canopy/examples/build/flat1_canopy.*

This is an idealized version of the target canopy because it has not accounted
for cell deformations, such as billowing.

Distortions
===========

**FIXME**: should I discuss cells, billowing, distortion, etc?


Case Study
==========

(This is where I'll introduce Belloc's reference wing and wind tunnel data.
I can refer to it when I'm showing examples of the chord surface geometries as
an real-world application of the chord surface concept.)

Every new tool should be validated, and for aerodynamic codes validation often
involves comparing theoretical models to wind tunnel measurements. For the
tools proposed in this paper, validation should include demonstrating the
flexibility of the geometry definition proposed in :doc:`paraglider_canopies`
and the performance of the aerodynamics code proposed in
:ref:`paraglider_dynamics:Non-linear lifting line theory`.

An excellent test case for the geometry and aerodynamics is available from
:cite:`belloc2015WindTunnelInvestigation`, which provides both point-wise
geometry data and wind tunnel performance.

It is important to notice the difference between the section numbers used here
and the section indices used in the parafoil canopy geometry.

Also, the reference data is defined with the wing tips at :math:`z = 0`,
whereas the chord surface convention places the canopy origin at the leading
edge of the central section. This is easily accommodated by the chord surface
implementation, which simply shifts the origin to suit the final geometry.

.. TODO:: Should I use these tables or just give the explicit equations?
   They're messy, bu I do like the fact that they highlight the fact that you
   **can** use pointwise data.

Inputting the values to the canopy geometry produces:
